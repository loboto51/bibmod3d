Description :

~~~
The ultimative tool for miniature painting! Clip in the base of your mini and you can paint without having to touch the mini at all, or getting paint on your hands. Especially useful when washing!

And for drybrushing, I included a structured 100x100mm plate to get to the perfect amount of paint on your brush, works much better than a paper towel.

There are two versions, one for bases between roughly 25mm and 50mm and one for bases between roughly 25 and 100mm ("PaintHolderFull").

Print:
1x Main Body
2x Clip
optional: 1x DistancePlate
1x Holder and Holder_Numbers
or 1x Full_Holder and Full_Holder_Numbers
or, for square bases, 2x Holder_Square or Full_Holder_Square

To assemble it, you need a rubber band, I usually use roughly 40mm diameter ones. Put it on one of the clips (for 40mm, I recommend doing two loops). You now need some kind of hook to pull your rubber loop through the whole assembly (check the images) and put it on the other clip. If you feel like the holders do not fit tight enough, you can add one distance plate on top of the main body. Since this highly depends on your print settings and tolerances, I'd recommend first testing it with and without distance plate and only then gluing it on top of the main body.
