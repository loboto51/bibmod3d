Description :

~~~
Mordor Uruk-hai of Cirith Ungol in 10mm scale.
 
These models were inspired by the Games Workshop minis for the Lord of the Rings the Return of the King. These models were designed to be used with the Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle game but were designed in 10mm (epic) scale not the standard 28mm scale.

NOTE: These models have not been test printed.
