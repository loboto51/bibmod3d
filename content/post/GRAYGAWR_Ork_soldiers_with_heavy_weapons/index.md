Description :

~~~
I rigged and reposed some of the fantastic Orks by VidovicArts to create a group of heavy weapons soldiers.

They were made as Ork Marauders for the Grim Dark Future tabletop game, but they can be used as proxys for any heroic scale wargame.

Remixed parts:
Ork Infantry by VidovicArts
Ork Ladz Heads and Arms by assaultsloth
Ork shoulder plates bits by rs_77
Miniature - Ork Heads (Heroic Scale) (2016) by whackolantern
Tankbastaz conversion kit wich I can't find online anymore..

For the real experience, print them with pink filament and apply clear coat. But that's up to you.

I will upload some more soon.
