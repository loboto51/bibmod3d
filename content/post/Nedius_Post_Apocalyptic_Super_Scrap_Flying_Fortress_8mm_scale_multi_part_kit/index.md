Description :

~~~
This cobbled-together flying piece of scrap metal looks as if it should fall apart under a gentle breeze. And yet, it barrels through the air with wild abandon; bullets, bombs and stranger projectiles flying from it in all directions. A mighty flying fortress, this super-scrap bomber all but ignores incoming fire as it passes harmlessly through open superstructure, or as it blasts away rusty plating that was all but falling off anyway, leaving critical structures safe below layers of bolted on scrap metal.

This 67 piece multi-part kit comes with a huge range of options. It can be built with two wing profiles, alternative hulls with differing tailfins, and a range of options for turrets and bombs, many of which can be mirrored for additional variety / symmetry. It includes  monstrous 'bouncing bombs' for some truly 'wild' bombing runs! 

The kit is designed to be scaled to 8mm scale model games, such as plane warfare games, or those featuring legions of models fighting. It could also be used in 6mm games where Epic Marines fight in Space, a real armageddon level battle. Compatable with ork style armies, it would be a great proxy for a mega bommber or landa. It is sufficiently detailed that an ambitious hobbyist could print it at 400% scale to create a huge center piece model or terrain for 32mm games set in grim dark universes. This would of course require additional cuts to the model! 

I am a hobbyist 3D modeller - not a professional 3D designed. However, this project has taken many, many hours of development, test printing and correction. It is my first 'paid for' model, a reflection of the time it took to create. Almost all my other models are currently available for free, so please do look through those if you are interested in further supporting me and my hobby. 

I also welcome feedback and will look to develop this model with improvments and additional options in future.
