Description :

~~~
Builder Doll for anyone wanting to have quality components for making your own Beaky Army remixes. Performed some serious fixes on Moonjam base parts and a newly constructed pauldron shell. Included is the KillMeForPrizes helmet. Legs originally from Danitblobby. Initially released as Meshmixer file since that  seems to be the lowest common denominator for people to use, it now contains a blender version as well.

For weapons and equipment check the &quot;Galactic Crusader Weapon Asset Pack Remaster&quot; on my cults.

If you like what I did and want to leave a tip it would be appreciated.

Edit 20220112: Corrected leg mesh that Meshmixer was always complaining about because it annoyed me. Didn&#039;t cause any issue printing but I&#039;m tired of seeing it.

Update 2022.09.27: Reworked all the meshes to clean up alignment issues and bad angles. Redesigned the chest to have the classic 3 power cables of RT beakies.

Update 2024.09.24: Uploaded a replacement blend version upon request
