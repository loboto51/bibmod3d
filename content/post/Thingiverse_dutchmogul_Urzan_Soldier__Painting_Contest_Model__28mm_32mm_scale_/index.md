Description :

~~~
The U.L.C. (Urzan Liberty Corps), is our new range that will serve as a proxy guard/sci-fi trooper army (whichever rules set you use, though we'll be designing our own as well). This guy requires support material (though not all of the models will).

CONTEST ALERT!!

We'll be launching a full range of U.L.C. (Urzan Liberty Corps) models soon, and we're doing a painting contest (using this ground pounder in firing pose). All you have to do to enter is download, print, and paint this little fella and post a make here on Thingiverse. We'll be choosing one entry here, and three from our Patreon supporters (posting their entries to our Patreon community page). All winners will receive the printable files early and for free, as they're designed, and before we run the Kickstarter/post them for sale to our [online storefront](http://www.illgottengames.net/products). The grand prize (chosen from Patreon submissions), will also get to request a custom urzan character model. The deadline is 4/30/19, and we'll announce the winners on 5/1/19.

For those of you thinking about supporting us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/illgottengames), our patrons get special access to our store releases as they come out (not to mention license options to sell printed versions of our designs).

Enjoy!
~~~
