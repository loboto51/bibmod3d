Description :

~~~
Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for an Wraith class cruiser for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. I'm not sure about the best way up to print the rear hull, my current thinking from the forward to the stern.

I am not affiliated with GW in any way! Please don't reupload this on Shapeways and the like for commercial use (though you're welcome to upload them to get them printed that way for yourself).

2019-02-06 - Got bored of my printer messing it up! So I've added one with the main hull sliced in half, which should be easier.

2019-02-16 - Added some detail to the rear hull (thanks Warpweaver!)

2019-02-24 - Redid the prow weapons a bit, and added premade models with the different weapons patterns.

2019-03-27 - Tweaked the prow and weapons a bit to make them print better.

2019-10-10 - Added more detail to the rear hull and upper prow.

2020-04-10 - Resized, made larger by 1.3x to match the originals better
