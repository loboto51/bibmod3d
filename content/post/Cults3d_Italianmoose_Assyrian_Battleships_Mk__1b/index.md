Description :

~~~
Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for Battleships for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. Detailed up to the nines, as much as I could bear. Good luck printing it all, resin is probably the way to go.

2019-12-07 - Tweaked the prow a bit, having a non-square spire looked wrong. Also added a WiP image of the main hull. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG THIS IS TAKING o.O

2019-12-26 - Merry Christmas, have the first full release!

2020-04-24 - Uploaded assembled versions of the major battleship classes

2020-05-31 - Corrected a slight error in the main hull and increased the connection between the prow eagle and the main hull
