Description :

~~~
Ork Savage Gunship for the long out-of-production wargame Battlefleet Gothic.

The model by jimjimjimmyjim (from Battlefleet Gothic Armada 2) didn't have any guns, so I mixed in some other big guns and scaled them appropriately. 

I have removed a lot of small gubbins from the original mesh, as it was far to small to print properly. This prints fine, as the picture clearly illustrates.

The cover picture shows two printed Savages along original Savages from the game.

2020-05-11: Added a pre-supported Chitubox file for easy printing of 3 Savages. Note: These Savages have stands permanently attached to them.
