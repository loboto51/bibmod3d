Description :

~~~
Provides a version of Woddish's excellent Tiny Tank Classic MBT and alman69uk's additional weapons that have been sliced into major parts that are enabled to be quickly swapped and edited for customization by changing visibility of components between different options for turrets and weapons to make Predator based vehicles (Destructor, Annihilator, Baal, Infernus, and plasma deimos pattern tanks). In addition, numerous mesh cleanup and extra details added.

This is intended for designers and modelers to product their own faction customized vehicles from in a standardized and high quality form. Comes with an easy How-To document explaining use for non-modelers as well.

If you like what I did and want to leave a tip it would be appreciated.
