Description :

~~~
A 10 mm Iron Hills chariot for Warmaster — or for The Battle of Five Armies, if you fancy reenacting the films. This one had been sitting on my to-do list for a while. Now that my own Warmaster armies are complete, I’ll probably slow down a bit and work through the models people have asked me to make.

I’m not the biggest fan of the movie’s take on Tolkien’s dwarves, but I did say I’d make this… and it turned out to be a lot of fun. I’m especially happy I managed to squeeze four goats and the cart onto a standard Warmaster base.

Here is the dwarf I generated with Tripo, but ended up changig nearly everything:
