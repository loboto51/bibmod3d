Commentary :

All of the design backgrounds were based on the Roguetrader (1st Edition) and the 2nd and 3rd Edition designs.

As always, based on the design of the time, I mixed the design sensibilities of the present era.

Personally, I recommend that the size of the shoulder pad is 105-108%, and the size of the head is 95%. (That looks good.)

I got a lot of help from my colleague, LegioXIVguy, in determining the ratio and size. So the overall size is about between New edition Chaos space marines and Primaris marines.

Please enjoy the Retro work.
