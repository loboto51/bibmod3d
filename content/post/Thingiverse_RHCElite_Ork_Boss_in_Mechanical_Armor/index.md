Description :

~~~
This is a combination of multiple free files to make an armored Ork Warboss with a two handed choppa. The files I used are:

Superbly Armored Warboss Remix - https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/superbly-armored-warboss-remix

Orks Big Choppa - https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/orks-big-choppa

Goblin Krew - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4656246

Ork Weapons - https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/ork-weapons

Ork Boyz Heavy Gunner Arms - https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/ork-boyz-heavy-gunner-arms

Ork Big Shoota Guns for FDM - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4790493

Ork Ladz Heads and Arms - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3946899


The files do have some errors, but I used Voxeldance Tango as a slicer which was able to automatically repair them, so they printed fine.
