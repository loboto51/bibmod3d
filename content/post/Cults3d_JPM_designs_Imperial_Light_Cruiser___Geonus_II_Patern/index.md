Description :

~~~
The Ruzisa Pattern Void Yacht is a luxurious, heavily customized reinterpretation of the Imperial Light Cruiser – Geonus II Pattern, repurposed not for war, but for status, prestige, and interstellar presence. Designed for use by planetary governors, noble dynasties, and high-ranking Rogue Traders, these ships are symbols of wealth, power, and refined taste within the Imperium.

While it retains elements of the original cruiser’s silhouette, the Ruzisa Pattern strips away most of its military infrastructure in favor of ornate architecture, custom superstructures, and ceremonial void chapels. The hull is reworked with lavish interiors, towering galleries, personal spires, arboretums, and frescoed observation domes—each vessel becoming a unique, spacefaring masterpiece.

Defensive capabilities remain: void shields and automated turrets provide a respectable level of protection, though the Ruzisa is not designed to endure the rigors of frontline conflict. Its most defining feature, however, is its colossal sub-light propulsion ring, a rare and fragile system that encircles its primary engine. This allows the yacht to achieve extraordinary cruising speeds, gliding through voidspace with unmatched smoothness. The cost and delicacy of this propulsion method prevent its use in most military contexts, but for a civilian vessel built to stay clear of danger and move with grace, it is ideal.

Each Ruzisa is custom-built, and no two are alike. Their baroque hulls may carry heraldry, relic vaults, or entire entourages of retainers, artists, or private militias. They are palaces with engines, and they serve their masters not only as ships—but as thrones among the stars.

Miniature Specs:
Length: 9,9 cm
Mounting: 3 mm
