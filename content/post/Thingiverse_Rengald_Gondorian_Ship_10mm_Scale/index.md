Description :

~~~
Gondorian Ship from the Port of Harlond 

This is a ship model inspired by the Lord of the Rings Return of the King. This model was designed to be used in the Lord of the Rings SBG. This model was designed in 10mm (epic) scale not the standard 28mm scale.

This model was designed to be used with the White Tree Ballistae from Wakes Emporium. Those are the models seen on the picture above.

NOTE: The included files are the boat ONLY. Models are not included.
