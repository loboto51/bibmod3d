Description :

~~~
This is a reduced collection of [this set here](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/hexagonal-residential-buildings-for-6mm-1-285-scale-gaming-tinnut) so that you can try them out.

In the distant future, humanity has learnt that hexagonal buildings are superior!

They're hexagonal residential buildings, for 6mm / 1:285 gaming - primarily Battletech but also Epic 40k and other games at that scale.

The buildings are combinations of hexagonal towers that equate to level 1, 2 and 3 within Battletech.  I've set level 1 at about 25mm which allows small mechs to still see over them and level 2 at about 55mm which blocks visibility of even the largest mechs I've tested.  Each level after that goes up 30mm.

They're designed to fit within the "standard" Battletech map hexes of 33mm flat edge to flat edge as is used in the current boxed sets. They also have a roof designed to allow Mech models to be placed on them.

The models are designed to be mostly supportless on an FDM printer and have printed fine on my Ender 3.

The two models shown are earlier test prints and the final models as uploaded include a couple of more details.  I'll be replacing the images once I paint up one of the updated versions.
