Description :

~~~
This is my design remix to properly make the most of those soda or beer can you drink while painting or playing warhammer40k. Give them a new life and make they look really cool in your game table.

This pack includes only the pieces to build the preview:

- 2 bottom supports and rings
- front imperial hatch
- back ventilation grille
- side control panel
- side pipe to the ground
- top ventilation fan
- top human access hatch and the ladder to get there

v2 (2021-04-11):

- Added parts needed to build a vertical container with a 330ml slim can. Only needs 2 beds to print in less than 4 hours.

v2.2 (2021-06-20):

- Added Adeptus Mechanicus symbol to 330ml slim version (also can be used as top part in the regular version). Thanks to @Turtlebot for the suggestion.

Also includes the pre-assembled project files for popular slider softwares. 3 beds for short-printing times and get a tank ready in a single day.

All credit goes to:

- Tijnemanske (for his amazing "soda can terrain" design. Search him in thingiverse)
- SevenUnited (for the control panel)
- PERECil (for the top hatch)
- me (I've made the ladder from scratch ^_^)
