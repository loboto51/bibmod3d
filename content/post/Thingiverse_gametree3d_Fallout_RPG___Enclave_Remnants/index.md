Description :

~~~
designed for and scaled for 15mm use with the Fallout Wasteland Warfare rpg ruleset. 

*edit* I've upgraded these designs to be individual files, to have bases, and reworked them to be more combat fluid with more generic / heavy weapons. I've also reduced some of overall thickness of the models and repositioned the head after noticing they were rather high on the body when I printed them. 

Not included in assets is garrymod enclave armor which has been meshed into the posable designs of miffles-makers awesome t51 kit.
