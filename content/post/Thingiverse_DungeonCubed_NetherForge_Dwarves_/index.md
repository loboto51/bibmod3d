Description :

~~~
These dwarves have dug their way out from the depths of the Netherforge and wish to reclaim some of the artifacts lost in the last city of Fellstead. (Frost Grave) With them they bring their fearsome stoic constructs and their tenacious stoats. 

I wanted to make a new Frostgrave warband/army for my brother. I came across the dwarf clan and netherforge constructs from dutchmogul (LINK: https://www.thingiverse.com/dutchmogul/designs) and decided to do some remixing. Hope others out there will enjoy these as well.

Each of these are made to be printed with little to no support and are printed best in resin.

If you enjoy this army please consider tipping dutchmogul as much of the files were remixed from his original files.
