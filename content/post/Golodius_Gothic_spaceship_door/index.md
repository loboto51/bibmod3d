Description :

~~~
Door, sleeper and bulkhead for all your space adventures, whether Space Hulk, futuristic dungeon crawler or grim dark RPG.





These pieces are part of a larger set that includes a whole series of tiles to create a modular game board. Feel free to take a look if you'd like to embark on this larger project.





You'll find 2 3MF files with supports, created with PrusaSlicer, as well as the STLs. Originally, these elements were intended for filament printing. However, the parts are small enough to be considered for resin printing if desired.
