Description :

~~~
Imperial frigates come in a dizzying variety of configurations, shapes, and overall capability, being the largest size vessel most Imperial shipyards can produce. Scouts, convoy escorts, and gunships are the most common, but light carriers and missile defence ships are also produced in large numbers.

Requires the turret options found in Imperial Cruisers and Body C uses the weapons options from Imperial Light Cruisers. Highly recommended for games of Battlefleet Gothic, could be used as a stand-in for Lunar Class cruisers in Epic: Armageddon (I suggest a squadron though), or bringing Imperial Truth to heretical space-games.

03/11/2017: Beefed up the prow, after seeing prints it had looked too slim. Added a prow with torpedo tubes for the Falchion class.

28/12/2017: Detailed the prows. Enlarged the holes to accept standard flight stands. Made Wing D both shorter and higher set on the body. Fixed up the assembled ships and added the Falchion class. 

03/01/2018: Added Prow B, Body D & Engine D. Added an assembled Sword using these new parts. This is hopefully the last edit I make to this design.
