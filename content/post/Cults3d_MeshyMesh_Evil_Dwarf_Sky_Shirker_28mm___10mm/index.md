Description :

~~~
Evil Dwarfs now have rocket power!

Files come pre-supported and not supported.

Comes with three crew as separate prints created for the Sky Shirker.

10mm version included.

Two types of rockets which rest just nicely in the firing compartment if you don't want to stick it on. Print both and mix and match or use as some extra detailing on bases.

Two types of levers which you can push into the holes found on the cannon. Print a few of each to mix and match.

****UPDATE 1/2/24****
To fit on a 50x75mm base resize the components in your slicer to 85%. Print crew at 100%. Pics show the size differences with crew printed at the same size.
