WIP

A collection of bases for playing popular older "6mm" games with modern "8mm" miniatures.

Filename format is BaseSize_CutoutSize_CutoutType_Variation, so "40x20_5x8mm_Inf2_Arrow" is a 40mm by 20mm base with five 8mm by 0.5mm sockets, which are round for Infantry, placed in an arrow formation. Cavalry have ovoid cutouts, and I'm doing several sizes of circular cutouts for infantry so that bigger models don't have to attach by balancing on a dinky wee 6mm integral base.

All the bases are 1.2mm thick with a 65 degree bevelled edge, as I wanted them low-profile and printable on an Ender 3(which likes .4 multiples for layer heights). I've included bases of the same thickness for "8mm" Titanic Robots which are accurately curved should you wish to use those models in both systems.

More will be added over time.
