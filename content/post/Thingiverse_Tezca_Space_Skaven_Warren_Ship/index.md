Description :

~~~
I have supplied a model with and without (sans) warpstone bits, so the ship can be used as something less specific than a Skaven vehicle.





A few mistakes were made in the late 90's that ended the presence of a couple of races in the Warhammer 40k universe. I made this ship for myself, to fill in one of those vacancies.


Fluff:

The Hrud (or Skaven) Warren Ship is the Hrudii battleship and their primary center of habitation and culture. The Warren Ships are similar to Eldar Craftworlds in that they serve as permanent homes, though are far smaller and vastly more numerous. Their technology, which is nearly as advanced as the Eldar, is powered by rare Warpstone that only the Hrud have found in great quantities.

Along with the various other Hrudii ship classes, the Warren Ship inhabits pockets in between the Immaterium and our own dimension into which they have "tunneled", using Warpstone to power their extradimensional drives. This gives the Hrud nearly unequaled latitude of travel in the galaxy, and insulates them from the predations of warp entities that would otherwise be greatly attracted to the concentrations of Warpstone that they use.


Millennia of relatively undisturbed advancement and inter-warren trading has created a civilization of royal city-states, ruled ostensibly as oligarchies. A city-state of this fashion, called a Clan House, will consist of many Warren Ships and hundreds of other warships and auxiliary craft, (though it stands to reason that greater craft, perhaps rivaling Eldar Craftworlds in size, exist in these realms). 


Given their empire's existence below the surface of the material galaxy, it's no wonder that they have only accidentally and improperly been codified by Imperial Magos Biologis adepts. However, the Hrud do need material supplies, which necessitates plying the darker regions of the material galaxy for food and ore. These "forages" sometimes bring them into conflict with the various sentient races of the galaxy, not least of which are the Squats.
