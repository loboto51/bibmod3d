Description :

~~~
Demon chariots for warmaster both with and without supports using one of Rubberlizard's awesome flyers (spikes taken from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4261970). after faffing about a bit trying to make an actual chariot I instead decided to take some artistic liberty; these are chaos demons! So instead of a literal chariot, you get a low-flying creature with a lot of nasty looking forward-facing spikes to crash into mortals with.

10mm demon army
See my collections for the other units; I have a unit for each of the roles in warmaster revolution and a couple of heroes. Note that this army does not inherently match one of the big four chaos gods by design, as I find them dreadfully boring.

Supports
The supports are auto generated by Prusa. It's easy to remove the supports, although this does tend to break the demon's body from the cylinder I added to anchor it to its base (I call it "Melody"). Oh well, easily solved with a bit of glue.

Why?
I just got a 3d printer and was looking to get into warmaster with some friends when I noticed that there is no ready to print demon army yet. Given my 0-level modelling skills I instead decided to use existing models to create the army; this unit is one of the outcomes of this project.

Disclaimer
To be sure: none of these models are actually mine. I am a complete hack blundering his way through blender; all I can do is resize models, fatten segments and add cylinders (you may spot some of my handiwork on other models, or here!).
