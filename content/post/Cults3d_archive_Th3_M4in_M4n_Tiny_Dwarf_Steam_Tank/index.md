Description :

~~~
There has always been the question:

Why does the Empire have steam tanks, supposedly based on dwarven technology, and the dwarves don't? Well not anymore! The dwarf arms race continues! (and it's not going to stop, I warn you) and today I bring you this powerful steam tank 100% dwarf design!

(with some inspiration from old Soviet tank prototypes from the First World War)

In terms of gameplay, I thought about simply using the Imperial Steam Tank rules, but I think it would be appropriate to modify them a little to make this tank less prone to failure, and at the same time tougher (It's dwarven technology and it's also made of pure gromril, after all), but obviously with a much higher point value.

But use it however you want n.n (presupported version included)
