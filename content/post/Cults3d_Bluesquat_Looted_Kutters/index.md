Description :

~~~
The oldest of the clan is known, and distrusted, for keeping contact with group of humans. But don't be fooled, looted and bought ships are as deadly and upgunned as any greenskin ship can be, bringing death through hundred of barrels to it's previous owners. 

**This pack includes :**
- 4x unique looted escorts.

The ships are roughly 50mm long and can be used to represent ork Onslaught or proxy an imperial navy sword for a pirate fleet.

_ The files are unsupported and come with a slot for 3mm or 1/8 inch stem.
_ The bases I like to use are free and can be found here :

_ This pack is available to anyone so please don't sell, reupload or redistribute the files/models.

**_My ork ships are based on or use free parts from Styxx83's excellent ork fleet, please take a few minutes to browse his work :**
