Description :

~~~
Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for a Tau Custodian class fleet carrier for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. The highlighted circle on the underside image is where there's a void built into the lower hull component for a mounting peg. The hole is 3 mm in diameter. The bare wings take 3x medium railgun turrets and 1x small ion turret apiece.

*** The correct scaling is 0.7x. I've uploaded a correctly scaled file Custodian v21 rescaled.stl***

I am not affiliated with GW in any way! Please don't reupload this on Shapeways and the like for commercial use (though you're welcome to upload them to get them printed that way for yourself).

2019-03-24 - Made all the ruts a bit wider to make them catch paint better.
2019-04-22 - As requested added the whole upper part of the hull as one piece. Just requires the bridge and lower hull printing separately. (Custodian v20)
