Description :

~~~
Light, duelist troops for your noble army of tiny imperial humans.  These are 10mm scale and should be printed with 0.025mm layer height, with supports, on a resin printer.  I am including the individual models, but also groups of five, and groups of five with pre-added supports for printing.  I didn't put these figures into strips, because they're supposed to be loose units, with five models per 40x20mm base.

These are remixed from tons of different bits here on Thingiverse.  Many are low-poly models Jimjimjimjimjim, to which I've added armatures, done some posing, and then added weapons.  I also decimated, thickened, scaled, based, etc.
