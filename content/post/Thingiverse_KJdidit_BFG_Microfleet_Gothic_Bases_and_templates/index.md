Description :

~~~
Microfleet Gothic is my terminology for half-scale BFG fleets and gaming. Game-play is conducted on a half-size board, with ranges and movement halved; minis, bases and markers are half-scale as compared to the original models (based primarily on the scale of the original STL files).

All ship models have an insert that accepts a 5x1mm magnet, as do all of the bases in this Thing. 20mm bases have been provided should the 15mm bases be too unstable for your cruiser minis (just be generous to your opponent with Nova Cannon coverage and blast marker contact if you're using 20mm cruiser bases).

The three 3-ship escort bases are convenient, and don't change much in the way of game-play; it's up to the players whether or not to use them.

No markers for orders dice or ordnance are provided; the orders dice can be found elsewhere on Thingi, as can ordnance (though I just use differently-colored 12mm dice to represent these, as they're about the right size for fighter/bombers/boarding craft, and for missiles if using the BFG XR options for torpedoes.

Fleets for the game can be found by searching with the Microfleet tag, or checking my Designs page.
