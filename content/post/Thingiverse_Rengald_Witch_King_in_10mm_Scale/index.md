Witch King of Angmar in 10mm Scale with "floating" crown

This model was inspired by art work done by Denis Gordeev and is a model designed to be used with the Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game but is made in 10mm (warmaster) scale, not the typicle 28mm scale.

This model has been printed on a Bambu A1 .02 nozzle and on a resin printer.
