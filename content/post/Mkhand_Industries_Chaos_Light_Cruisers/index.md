Description :

~~~
The warships of Chaos will often be a mixture of ship classes, with whole sections of ship swapped out according to the whims of their masters. The wrecked hulks of Imperial ships are particularly prized as being durable and standardized enough to make such modifications relatively straightforward. 

Consists of a more true-to-inspiration weapons bay, a new side wing & command deck and a prow & its turrets taken from Dockmaster's Abyssal ships and scaled down. All parts are fully compatible with Imperial Light Cruisers, and barring the wing & command deck can go with Astartes Cruisers. Required weapons options & engines can be found in Imperial Light Cruisers or Astartes Cruisers. 

Ideal for games of Battlefleet Gothic, representing orbital support in Epic: Armageddon, and for conquering other, lesser, space games.
