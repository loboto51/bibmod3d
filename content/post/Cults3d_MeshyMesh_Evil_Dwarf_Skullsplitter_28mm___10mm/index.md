Description :

~~~
Evil Dwarfs are forever creating diabolical engines of destruction.
Behold the mighty Skullsplitter, designed to mine but we all know its really made to crack open some skulls!

Files come pre-supported and unsupported.

Includes 10mm version also which can be printed in a single print with individual crew but has the usual strengthening and reduction in detail.

Comes with three crew, adjustable arms (or more static arms) to hold the big front blade and adjustable arms for the hammers.
This is a kit with multiple pieces and assembly can be a little fiddly, so I have included a handy pdf on assembly and some tips.
I'd recommend taking a quick read before assembly.

Happy printing and cracking them skulls!
