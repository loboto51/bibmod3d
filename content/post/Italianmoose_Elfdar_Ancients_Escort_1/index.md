Description :

~~~
These are based off the really old concept sketchs for the Space Fleet models. This is escort sized (~40 mm long), and comes with several different weapons fits: Torpedo tubes, lances, or a assault module nose. Supported and plain files.

The mesh is a bit manky, let me know if it's coming out in the print. I'll update it if/when Autodesk fixes the issue.

These will proxy in BFG for Shadowhunters, or for Corsair class escorts. And maybe one day there will be specific rules! Or you could just play Space Fleet ;)

Please note that you are not able to sell prints of these files.

2021-12-04 - Big shout out to DoubleBaseFanatic who has test printed and re-supported these for transparent resins which are much more fussy about support proximity.
