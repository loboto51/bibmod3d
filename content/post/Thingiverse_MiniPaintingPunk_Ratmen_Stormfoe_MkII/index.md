Description :

~~~
Decided to try and make my Stormfiend model a little closer to the source material, very little sculpting myself, just combing the works of other designers but still quite happy with the results.
 Test print had few minor failures (see Makes), have added a version with some extra manual supports, will update once printed with results (supports are not complete just there to help along the others).
