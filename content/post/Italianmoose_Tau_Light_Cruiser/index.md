Description :

~~~
Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for a Tau Emissary class light cruiser for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. Bare and armed variants. Not my finest work, I will be the first to admit. This is not an easy hull shape to design in CAD! But it's done, and now you have this vicious little cruiser to play with! 

There is a hole for a base step under the hull, drill through the circle on the underside. My intent is for this to be printed in one go, from stern to prow. The prow will need some support.

I am not affiliated with GW in any way! Please don't reupload this on Shapeways and the like for commercial use (though you're welcome to upload them to get them printed that way for yourself).
