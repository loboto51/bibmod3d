Description :

~~~
Edit: May 2021- I've updated the models to make them friendly for hollowing for printing on resin printers.  Any manifold issues have also been fixed.

This is a part of a collection of 35 rectangular residential buildings, for 6mm / 1:285 gaming - primarily Battletech but also Epic 40k and other games at that scale.

This is actually a sample from a much larger collection that I sell over on the Cults3d site: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/residential-buildings-for-6mm-1-285-scale-gaming.  That collection currently includes over 160 buildings in four different styles and I'll continue to expand it in the future. 

The buildings are combinations of "tower blocks" that equate to level 1, 2 and 3 within Battletech.

They're designed to fit entirely within the "standard" Battletech map hexes of 33mm flat edge to flat edge as is used in the current boxed sets. They also have a roof designed to allow Mech models to be placed on them.

The models are designed to be mostly supportless on an FDM printer and have printed fine on my Ender 3.


Please note that in the photo the building on the left is from an earlier test print and that the window size in the connector sections was made slightly thinner in the final design.
