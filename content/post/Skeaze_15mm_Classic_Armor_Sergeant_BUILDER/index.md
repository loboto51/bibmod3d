Description :

~~~
15mm GMO super-soldier leaders.

I have included 4 pre-made figures (pictured here), but the main attraction is a full builder which allows you to customize dozens of different head, torso, and shoulder pad options, and a handful of the most common pistol and melee weapon options. PDF instructions for how to use the builder are included. Choose the combination of parts you want, and easily export them into a custom miniature!

Various free parts have been meticulously pulled apart, resized, reproportioned, altered, or remodeled myself. Then reassembled and posed. They have been made to match the proportions of the famous 8mm "Galactic Crusaders", but with much more detail.

These guys are 17-18mm at the eye, or 19-20mm at the top of the head.
