Description :

~~~
These old space elves have a strange thing for popping out of the shadows and hitting people with swords... and shooting shurikens at them. They seem to be friends of the farsighted old dudes, but I wouldn't really know. Thanks to Direwolf for coming up with the names, I wouldn't have come up with something so clever. 

I would recommend that you print these with a resin printer, there are a few really thin spots that probably won't print well with FDM. 
Print at 110%-115%, depending on how large you want them. 110% looks right to me.

Thanks to jimjimjimmyjim and Kalle_Paulson for the models, I really only posed and tweaked them slightly.
