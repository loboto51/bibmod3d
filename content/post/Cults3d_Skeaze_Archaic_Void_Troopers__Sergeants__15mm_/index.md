Description :

~~~
This pack contains void trooper leaders equipped with various pistols and melee weapons. There are 3 different pistol options (laser pistol, plasma pistol, and rivet pistol), and 3 different melee options (sword, power fist, harpoon). Each combination of pistol and melee weapon is represented in a distinct pose, so there are 9 total models!

If you want to see a certain weapon combination, but in a different pose (for example; you like the pose of the plasma+harpoon, but want the plasma pistol swapped out with a laser pistol) just let me know and I'll put it together and upload it!

<>

There are both unsupported, and pre-supported* versions of each, including Lychee files.

*I tend to go heavier on the supports (I'd rather spend a little more time cleaning up supports than have a failure and have to completely re-print it). I use the "hot water method" for removing supports to make it easier. I can't guarantee it will work for all printers and resin though.

Justification du tag SUP :

There are both unsupported, and pre-supported* versions of each, including Lychee files.
