Description :

Now with Pre-supported versions!

Hail, Fellow Scions!

The standard chain-weapon on my Smaller Knights is nice, but I wanted something nasty and visceral when I'm chopping heretics, mutants, and xenos to tiny bits!

So, I sculpted up a ring-like blade weapon.

I magnetize my Knights at the elbow. There's is a socket there for whatever method you prefer. There are a number of parts...

1-The blade assembly. Both ring and chainsword versions.
2,3,4- Various poses of the elbow/rear weapon section. Contracted, Extended, or at 90 degrees in orientation.
-
The blade sections and rear weapon section fit together via plug and socket.

You can also glue shields or extensions in between the two main segments for some extra flair.

Make sure you send in pics of your Makes!

Instead of tips, please check out my science fiction series on Amazon. Read the preview chapters, and if you like it, download the ebook.

Armored mech warfare in the arenas and streets of a place called Junctionworld!
Lots of mecha chainsword action!

Thanks,
