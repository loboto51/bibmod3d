Description :

~~~
Is this a serious release? Not really... Since so many of my 0.2mm nozzles on my Bambu A1 were failing, I thought maybe one could upcycle these as weapons in tanks. And while being on that, I decided to do that for empty ArmyPainter bottles, too. And since I was experimenting a bit with stuff, I decided to try to AI generate three more tanks. So here you are! 5 Tanks that you could play in your games (and I'd be happy if you did and showed me images), but it's quite questionable if you did.

Of course I forged them into a library for my customizer! Have fun combining them with my other scrap tanks!
