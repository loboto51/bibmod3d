Description :

~~~
Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for a Firestorm-class frigate for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. It needs some support to print under the bridge, and underneath the whole thing to connect it with the print bed. It's much easier to print the prow lance as a separate component.
