Description :

~~~
I cut the model up, to make it easier to print.

I made a very small modification to the back bottom of the hull. The engine compartment stuck out on the bottom back, I cut this off to make it easier to print, and I didn't like the look of it. Also, I removed some small parts connected to the "nose" of the ship that remained there due to the cut. Both of these adaptations are minuscule.

Besides that, I really like the model, and will be printing it soon!
