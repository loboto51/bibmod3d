Description :

~~~
I start from the excelent work of AxoloteGaming and onebitpixel.
Take a look and support them, they are great!
I'll be glad if I can work on something with them someday.

Join my website to get all of them for free

I've got a lot of fun remixing them while learning remixing. I spent more than 300h on them. I could not stop trying new things, And I've only done half what I wanted to. Once I got more free time I'll add more content. Post me what you want to see in the next set.

I made them to be printed as cheap as possible 0.8/1.2 shell 3 or 5% infill.

Most of them can be printed without support. I tested allmost all of them. Let me know if you have an issue I'll try to fix it asp. Just check the first layer to be sure it's ok before start printing.

The minis are only here for scale purpose.
