Description :

~~~
A battleship, Light and regular cruisers, all with a demonic twist. Great for Battlefleet Gothic or other space miniatures games. These will take a bit of modeling work to clean up. Weapons inserts will fit, but may need a little filing along the sides (as they are very snug).

Fun trick, try using a flame (like from a BBQ lighter) to quickly pass over the stringy PLA filament strands strands to clear them. Just don't hold it in one place for too long otherwise you'll get melting... or possibly burning.

1/3/'18 a little update, I've improved the launch bay's slightly as I found the originals looked a little too small for the frame. I've also increased the size on the battleship by 7.5%, just to make it slightly more imposing.
