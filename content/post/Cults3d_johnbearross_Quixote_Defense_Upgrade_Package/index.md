---------------------------------------------------------

	The Tortuga Group, a heretofore relatively unknown defense contractor, recently unveiled an upgrade suite for the venerable Quixote-class mech chassis.

	Their Quixote Defense Upgrade Package is a long-distance take on the concept of mechanized walker warfare, with an emphasis on stand-off weaponry and heavy shielding.  This may not be suited for the mechanized arenas of Junctionworld, but mercenaries on the open battlefields found throughout the worldgate networks are sure to benefit.

	The new Spina Mk.II C-Beam Cannon is devastatingly effective on distance targets, with the damage inflicted usually an inverse to the target’s proximity.

	For closer adversaries that slip past the C-Beamer, a Redmaw Persecutor-class Plasma Cannon dispenses superheated damage, though its recharge rate has caught some pilots short.  Thus, a heavy flamethrower is also added to the Spina Mk.II for supplemental in-close coverage.

	Adding to the new upgrade’s enhancements is the Testudo VI Force Field projector, a variation on shielding systems found on heavier kaiju-fighting megamechs and titans.  When properly modulated, this generator can be used to deflect heavy incoming fire, or lend its protection to nearby units.

---------------------------------------------

This kit includes...

1 Plasma Cannon with two optional barrels.
1 C-Beamer Cannon with Auxiliary Flamethrower
2nd Generation Weapon Arms and Upper Arms with support rims to add stability.
1 Force Field Generator with two options of flat magnetized mount or a peg compatible with Imperial Warrior and similar builds.

Enjoy!

Best,
John Bear Ross

Again, that checkout code is LOWKEY20
Thanks!
