Description :

~~~
Death comes in many forms. For this death, it's a ball. Also includes 2 genetic gathering and sampling assistants for free.

For a Devilfish, it's the wrong shape, wrong size, wrong weapon options, and can't technically carry any Kroot, but it's lovely just the same. This was supposed to be a simple joke project that got out of hand. The level of detail isn't the same all over but it's taken up too much of my time and I just need to move on. 

* Comes with open and closed version of the side and back hatches. 
* It can either be assembled using 1.75mm filament as alignment pins or 10x2mm magnets. 
* Magnets allow for easy breakdown to swap open/closed hatches or easier travel. 
* Sides can be printed mirrored for more variety.


You will need heads to complete these models. I recommend purchasing the official box sets for those. Hopefully this will tell THEM that we want more options to add them to our armies. Alternately, if you have a resin printer, another modeler has made these: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4011591
