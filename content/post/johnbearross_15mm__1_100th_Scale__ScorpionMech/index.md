Description :

~~~
There is a new terror stalking the arenas and battlefields of Junctionworld and its worldgate networks.

Eerie in the contrast of their lethal size and silent movement, ScorpionMechs are sent through hostile interdimensional portals as shock attack units, scything and slicing through any resistance on the other side.

In the Gatekeepers' colosseums of mechanized bloodsport, ScorpionMechs have quickly earned a reputation as close-quarter killers, their tail weapons well-placed to send a buzzsaw or energized claw into an opponent's cockpit, regardless of shielding.

In conventional fights, the scuttling nightmares are sometimes inserted on to the a planetside battlefield via the use of a-grav or chemical rocket packs bolted under their hulls.

They are utilized when no quarter is to be given to the enemy, and none expected.

They're colony killers. Merciless reapers. Harvesters of those foolish enough to try and face them.

Using a variety of modular payloads, the ScorpionMech pilot can tailor their unit's weapons suite to the mission, whether it be cold, quiet up-close killing, napalm and gatling cascades at ballistic distances, or missiles from beyond the horizon.

The base package for the 15mm (I use 1/100th scale) ScorpionMech includes pincers, saws, Asher claws (named for Neal Asher, whose books you should really check out), gatlings, flamethrowers, and gun clusters. Supplemental mounts are provided for heavy cannons and missile launchers.
As mentioned above, orbital assault belly packs are also included.

This is a pretty decent undertaking, not for the faint-hearted. Rest assured, though, the largest piece (the main hull) will fit in a Mars 2 or similar-sized printer.

Details and links are in the included PDF instructions. If you want, you can preview them here at this WeTransfer link.  Some steps can be skipped, since the parts are pre-fused as you get smaller and smaller...
