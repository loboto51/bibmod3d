Description :

~~~
UPDATED VERSION AVAILABLE

Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for Battleships for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. Prints in sections, the wings and main hull are need some support material. This is a bit of a biggie, print times will probably be looonnnggg.
I've also added a figurehead designed in Oculus Medium, it's a tricky experiment! Let me know if it works.

2018-11-08 - Added a standard Imperial Eagle figurehead. Combine in your preferred software! 
2018-12-16 - Added a split hull, I was having terrible bed adhesion issues (mostly my printer being rubbish, but it helps). Also opened up the weapons bays a bit.
