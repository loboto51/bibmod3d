Description :

~~~
25.05.2021 Update: I have separated all of the parts as this needs to be printed with supports. Now you can print each person separately and glue them to the base however you want. I also adjusted the Nobori so it will not break so easily. Cheers.

Here is my first Samurai Daiymo, general, or warlord ready to lead his troops at 10mm scale across the battlefield. As per warmaster, this has a 25mm round base to hold the general and his attendants. He is attended by a Samurai giving him his Katana and a standard bearer holding his Nobori.
