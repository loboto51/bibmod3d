Description :

~~~
An easy-to-use tool for creating awesome ready-to-print bases for small scale wargames. Open this streamlined builder in Blender (3.4+)  to quickly generate supported bases for any vehicle in just a few clicks.

Hovercraft? Flyers? Super-heavy walkers? God-machines? Even >*gasp*< tanks!? Print an entire Legion's worth of bases in a single print-run with high quality vertical supports!

Includes:
- An innovative Continuous Support System inspired by The Custom Bit's work on the Txarli Factory Thematic Bases 2.0 Kickstarter, allowing you to easily print large numbers of warp-free bases with minimal resin use and next to no clean-up!
- 32mm, 40mm, 50mm, 65mm, 80mm Round Bases
- 105x70mm, 120x92mm Oval Bases
- Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large Tank Bases
- Add optional magnet holes in any size, spaced evenly across the base
- Add an optional hole for flight stands or pins
- Add optional procedurally generated texture toppers (currently including cracked earth and several grains of grit texture)
- Overlap multiple toppers for more interesting designs!
- Lattice modifiers for fine-tuning grit textures. Exagerate or hide textures in certain places, or carve out rocks, hills and valleys!

Want a consistent look for your entire army? Check out the Epic Infantry Base Builder!
