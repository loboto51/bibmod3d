Description :

~~~
Designed up this dealer button to use in home games or have just as something laying around for any poker fan.  It was inspired by a dealer button in Pokerstars VR.

Printing:

Ring - Infil to add weight, supports needed for spade inset.  Letter embossing doesn't need it.
Spade - Infil to add weight, no supports
Letters - Print flat, already scaled to fit nicely in the embossing
Star - Infil to add weight.

Full print with 4x4x4 walls/top/bottom and 38% infil came to about 48g in weight.  

Glue in lettering and spade.  Star may need minor sanding but should push fit into the space tightly and not need anything else to secure it.
