Description :

~~~
This is a proxy representing a Rogue Trader Brigantine from the out-of-print board game Battlefleet Gothic, from Games Workshop.

It contains some elements from other authors. I've used the imperial cruiser from Italianmoose as an inspiration to get the general look, so it blends with the rest of the imperial fleet (although I've given it a more sports-like look), but I've also taken some parts directly from the original model. The statues of the hull are from Harrowtale, but sadly on a FMD printer you will only get the basic shape. The bridge is adapted from Tezca, because I think is very cool and I think it really fits in.
The hull should be printed with supports.

There is also a battery bay from Italianmoose, which is what's intended to go in the hull slots, but if you wish to use a different loadout,the following two links have compatible weapons:

The assembled model is there for reference, not for actual printing.
