Description :

~~~
The blasphemous civil war has spread across the galaxy, and some of the GMO super soldiers have decided to make armor held together by lots of big round studs...

Currently only contains: Rocket Launcher, Automatic Cannon, Big Lazer, Big Flame Thrower. Still working on Plasma, Big Rivetgun, and Melty gun.

These have been slightly altered, reproportioned, and assembled from various free files. Big thanks on this one to TheAdditiveManufacturer for the heavy weapons! As-is they are slightly taller (and a lot bulkier) than a normal 15mm model. For totally lore-accurate "true scale" you might want to scale them up a tiny bit more.
