Description :

~~~
Here is a Hell Crab I made months ago, you will need naturally need to print multiple joints, 4 leg joints , and two claw joints.  if you print spiked legs , there are two versions having them point outwards, so two of each. If you go with the Leg or Twinspiked version, you can just print four of the same.

(the TurretMount is just a little base if you want to raise the head up, personally I like putting the turret on without it , and have it set low) 

have fun assembling =) 




I've made a third design of a Hell Crab , so that may come shortly too

If you like what I do , hit the like button, and if you like it a lot,  I’d be thankful for 
 considering leaving a tip, how ever small , to boost the motivation to keep releasing 
 more 6mm joy. Cheers
