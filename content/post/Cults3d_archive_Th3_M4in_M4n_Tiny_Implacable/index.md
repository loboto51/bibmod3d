Description :

~~~
A tiny mobile mortar for your army. I discarded the original open top concept of this steam tank because it would be pain for modeling, printing and paint the interior of the tank, so i remade the design for a enclosed mortar and swivel guns at the sides. 

This is not the last steam tank in my list; i also want to modeling the Deliverance (with its secondary boiler) and a version with a Hellblaster (for wich i need to design the Hellblaster battery in first place, also as an artillery unit), but now i want to finish to writing the special rules i have in mind for each one of the steam tanks i made so far.
