Rules for Tokyo Rampage. 

What you need to play the game. 
Terrain features are the none mobile bits that the monsters destroy on their rampages. They may be mounted on any size of base, but the dimensions of the base must be in multiples of 25mm.
Units are the combatants in the game. The types of unit used in the game are summarised below:
Civilians
Civilians are innocent bystanders. Their main purpose is to run, screaming,from the monsters attacking their city and basically get in the way.
Military
Military units range from squads of soldiers to mecha. They defend cities against the attacks of giant monsters.
Monsters
Monsters are the strange creatures that have come to destroy the city. They are not limited to giant lizards, but may include any creature or machine that is bent on destruction. Monsters can also be part of the city defences. However, they have to be careful what they stand on.
Ideally 1/300th scale figures should be used to represent units. Civilian and Military units should be mounted on 25mm square bases. Monsters may use bases of any size, but the base used will show the area the monster occupies.

Sequence Of Play
Each turn consists of the following phases:
Initiative. All players roll 1d6 to determine the number of Actions they may use this turn. The player with the most actions has the initiative.
Active phase. Each player takes one action in order of initiative. This continues until all actions have been taken.
Passive phase. The reactions of units which have not acted in the Active Phase are determined. This is done by rolling on the appropriate reaction table for the unit.
Once all phases in a turn have been completed, the next turn begins.
Actions
Each Action represents an opportunity to attack or move. Units may move and attack several times in one turn, provided enough actions are spent to allow them to do so. Any units of the same side which are in base-to-base contact, and which remain so for the duration of the Action, may be treated as a single unit for the purposes of spending Actions. Actions may not be saved for use in later turns.

Movement
Each unit has a Move Value (MV) and a Move Type. The MV is the distance (in cm) a unit may move per Action. The Move Type is the type of movement a unit uses and is used to determine the effect of terrain on its movement.
Move Types
There are six Move Types used in Trash Tokyo. These are explained below:

AIR
Air movement is flight. Units with this type of movement may have a minimum MV (shown as Max MV/Min MV). Units with a minimum MV must move this distance or they are assumed to have crashed and been destroyed. Units which do not have a minimum MV are able to hover in place.
See terrain effects.

BURROW
Some monsters (and possibly some vehicles) are capable of tunnelling through solid matter. Burrowing units are not placed on the playing area until they surface.
See terrain effects.

G.E.V.
This represents vehicles which use thrusters, ducted fans or anti-gravity systems in order to hover just above the surface they are crossing.
See terrain effects.

GROUND
Ground movement is assumed to be any form of movement which requires direct contact with the ground. This includes legs, wheels and tracks.
See terrain effects.

SUBMARINE
Submarine movement allows units to move underwater. Submerged units are not placed on the playing area until they surface.
See terrain effects.

WATER
This is the ability to cross bodies of water. Ships use this Move Type.
See terrain effects.

Take-offs And Landings
Units with the AIR Move Type may take off or land as part of their movement. In order to do so, they must declare this before they conduct any movement. They must then spend an Action to move in a straight line at their minimum MV. At the end of the move, the unit is either airborne or on the ground. No other Actions may be taken by the unit during this turn.

Terrain
There are three types of terrain in Trash Tokyo: Good, Bad and Impassable. A unit on Good Terrain suffers no penalty to its movement. A unit on Bad Terrain has its movement halved. Units on Impassable Terrain may not move at all. If a unit's move crosses more than one type of terrain, it counts the whole move as being on the worst terrain.
The following table gives examples of terrain for each Move Type. 

Move Types
Move type	good	bad	Impassable

Air	No high obstacles	High Obstacles (high obstacles are things like sky-scrapers,barrage balloons, mountains, very tall trees)	N/A

Burrow	Solid Matter	Not-so solid matter (eg,beneath cities, buildings,badly faulted rock)	Everything else

G.E.V.	Roads, water, fields	Destroyed buildings,woods, rough ground	Buildings

Ground	Roads, fields	Destroyed buildings, rough ground,woods	Water, Buildings

Submarine	Underwater	Water surface	Everything else

Water	Water surface	N/A	Everything else

Buildings
Buildings are items of terrain which can be damaged. A building can be anything from a skyscraper to a pylon, or a bridge to a gas tank. . A building is assigned a Defence Value (DV). This determines how fragile the building is. Once a building is destroyed, the area where it stood is considered to be rubble. Some buildings may have special effects associated with them. For example, electricity pylons may electrocute any monster in contact with them, or gas tanks may explode if damaged. The special effects associated with buildings, if any, should be decided upon before play commences.

COMBAT
Units which are capable of carrying out an attack have an Attack Value (AV), a Range and an Attack Type. The AV represents how much damage the attack is capable of doing. Range is the maximum distance (in cm) the attack may be used to. The Attack Type describes the attack and helps determine its effects. Attack Types The following Attack Types are used in Trash Tokyo. Each attack should have at least one Attack Type from this list.
Chemical
This represents attacks which are based upon noxious gases, corrosive liquids or other, similar substances.
Cold
Cold attacks work by lowering the temperature of the target until it suffers damage.
Electrical
The attack uses an electrical charge in order to do damage.
Heat
These are the opposite of Cold attacks. Heat attacks include flamethrowers and Martian heat-rays.
Impact
Impact attacks use kinetic energy to do damage. Most conventional attacks (ie, guns, claws, etc.) are Impact-based.
Light
The attack uses a burst of high intensity light to disable its target. This is usually a laser beam of some description.
Mental
These are attacks which do not manifest themselves physically. Instead, these attacks are more subtle in their operation. A successful mental attack generally allows one player to control another player's units. The exact effects of a given mental attack should be agreed upon by the players.
Radiation
Radiation attacks cover those weapons which use radioactive energy, strange charged particles or other phenomena beloved by physicists.
Sonic
Any attack which uses powerful sound waves is a sonic attack.
An attack may use more than one Attack Type. However, this only increases the chance that it will get past a monster's defences. An attack with more than one Attack Type only rolls for damage once per attack, not once per Attack Type.
Attacking
In order to use an attack, a unit must pick a visible target that is within the range of its attack.
For a unit to use a weapon with a range of 0cm, it must be in base-to-base contact with its target. 
Range (and line of sight) is measured between the centres of units. If the path is not obstructed by intervening scenery then the unit may open fire.

Damage
For each point of AV in an attack, the player rolls lD6. Damage is scored as follows:
D6   Damage
1-3       No damage
4,5       1 point of damage
6         2 points of damage 
The amount of damage done is totalled up and then applied.
Applying Damage
If a target unit has Damage Points, it suffers damage equal to the amount of damage inflicted by the attack divided by its DV. If a unit's Damage Points ever reach 0, the unit is destroyed.
If a target unit does not have Damage Points, the amount of damage inflicted by an attack is divided by its DV to give a number. A d6 is rolled and the result compared to that number. If the d6 roll is less than the number calculated, the target is destroyed. Otherwise, it is unaffected.
Units with a DV of 0 are automatically destroyed by an attack.
If a unit is vulnerable to a certain Attack Type, the unit is treated as having a DV of 1 against that attack.
Destroyed units are immediately removed from the table.
If a Monster suffers damage, as well as losing Damage Points, the Monster also loses its next Action.

Reaction Tables
In Trash Tokyo, reaction tables are used to control units (or groups of units) which are not under the direct control of a player. This includes units which have not used any Actions in a turn. Each unit (or group of units) is rolled for once per turn. The reaction table conditions are read from left to right and the first applicable column is used. A D6 is rolled, the modifiers added and the result applied. You are encouraged to experiment with these tables, particularly the Monster Reaction Table. After all, not every monster reacts in the same way, or even to the same things. In fact, some of them may even be intelligent...

Revenge Of The Giant Radioactive Dinosaur
Downtown Tokyo is threatened by a Giant Radioactive Dinosaur. The citizens have been evacuated and the Monster Defence Forces have been called in. In the meantime, it is up to the army to keep the creature from destroying the city.
This is the standard Trash Tokyo city-stomp. If you get bored with it, try a three-way fight with two monsters fighting against each other and the military trying to keep the damage to a minimum. Alternatively, have a monster on the side of the defenders. Just make sure he doesn't step on anything important.

The civilians should be controlled by the Civilian Reaction Table.Alien units may leave and board the Flying Saucer at a rate of 2 units per Action spent.
For this scenario, the Flying Saucer is effectively grounded. It will only move if it loses more than 50% of its Damage Points. If this occurs, the Flying Saucer will take off 1d6 turns later. Any Alien units on the playing area will attempt to return to the Flying Saucer before it leaves. If the Flying Saucer loses 75% of its Damage Points it will leave immediately.
