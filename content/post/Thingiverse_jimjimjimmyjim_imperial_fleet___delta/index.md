Description :

~~~
 cant recall the name of these ships but im sure you fans would know what they are

they need to be scaled correctly but i mostly left it as it was exported, cos i wanted to preserve as much detail for those of you who would care as much as i do about preserving details.

i have several more ships to upload, meanwhile be patient with me as i clean the other models up :)
