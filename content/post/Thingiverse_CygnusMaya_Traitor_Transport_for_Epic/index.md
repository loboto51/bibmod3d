Description :

~~~
Here are a few Traitor Transports remixes, two main versions with the three different rams, a few odd balls, and also included, a Hunter/Stalker for whom the AAGun is for.

Mainly I've just given them different top hatches and side doors, with icons and a few spikes here and there.  
the IW ones are simply rocking a skullicon. PLA within PLA without (or resin I suppose) 

If you like what I do , hit the like button, and if you like it a lot,  I’d be thankful for 
 considering leaving a tip, how ever small , to boost the motivation to keep releasing 
 more 6mm joy. Cheers 
~~~
