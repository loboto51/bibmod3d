Description :

~~~
10mm undead knights for Warmaster. Five plus one strips, three regular knights and two command ones. I added a wight lord as well and a command strip with him as the unit champion. The wight lord is a fantastic design, I could not not include him.

I broke the tail of one of the horses while removing the supports. I think that is the weakest part, you might want to watch out there. It seems strong enough when cured though. I have not painted them yet, I hope they will survive my violent drybrushing.
