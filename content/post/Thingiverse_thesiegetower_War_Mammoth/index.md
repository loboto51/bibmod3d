Description :

~~~
This is a 12mm downscaling of the Chaos War Mammoth seen here on thingiverse.com in the past. Used in Warmaster Middle-earth in the Haradrim Army list, as well as in the Chaos forces in other game systems. This model does NOT come with a crew, but one can be found here https://www.patreon.com/BriteMinis/posts . The miniatures are 28mm Saracens and must be scaled down 37% to use with this model. The base is 40mm x 60mm.

*DISCLAIMER* I am not the designer of this miniature and do not take credit for it's initial creation, just the downscaling. Cheers!
