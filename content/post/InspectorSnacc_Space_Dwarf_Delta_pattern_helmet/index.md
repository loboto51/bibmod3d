Description :

~~~
The Delta Pattern helmet is a 3D printable helmet designed for Space Dwarfs, inspired by the iconic helmets worn by the legendary Spartans.
I have added a fixed pose for warrior units, however I haven't been able to test it's fit as I don't have any unglued warriors if you end up downloading please let me know if I need to make changes
