Description :

~~~
+++ Traditionally the elite warriors known as the Hearthguards accompany the Warlord as his personal bodyguards, however their duties do not end there. Hearthguards who are not in the direct service of the Warlord take the position of platoon "captains", leading troops directly into battle. Only when a Hearthguard has proven to be a charismatic leader, a resourceful strategist, and a skilled warrior, he can be considered to be part of the Warlord's personal guard in the future.

The Hearthguards go into battle accompanied by an retinue of warriors selected from among the most skilled and trusted veterans, as they carry valuable weapons known as "heirloom weapons." These weapons are evidence of the maximum skill of the squat artificers, surpassing in every aspect their more common equivalents, and many of them have been in service of the squat noble families for centuries and some even millennia. +++

This is a Squat Hearthguard unit designed for NetEpic Armageddon, in specific for the Grindel Sronghold army list that you can find here: https://tacticalwargames.net/taccmd/viewtopic.php?f=134&t=33281&sid=422418b4bea515739e1aef8d862588e5

I designed 3 Hearthguard models, all equiped with a plasma and volkite pistols. Also i included a banner-bearer squat.

You can complete the unit using the warriors models that i already uploaded.
