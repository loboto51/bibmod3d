The war for Renner’s World is not going well for the embattled forces defending their home from the invading Kaiju. The abominable walking mega-fauna are now manifesting new abilities and incorporating cybernetic systems and replacement limbs, hinting at a more sinister force behind the invasion through the world-gates.

To compensate for this growing threat, the members of the Renner Defense League command staff have dusted off old plans from the Project Gigante design competition, the JagdHund, or Hunting Hound. JagdHund was a concept once deemed too large and unwieldy for the battlefield, but it has been recalled to the forefront as the threat literally grows larger.

JagdHund’s paired heavy gatling weapons are capable of dealing with hordes or point targets with equal ease, while the dorsal-mounted main gun, a superheavy maser cannon, is dedicated to frying and boiling the larger monsters emerging through the dimensional breaches. The directed energy weapon is an experiment, and has not been properly developed to withstand the rigors of close-range combat with kaiju. Plans are in the works to add different weapons and countermeasures to the JagdHund arsenal.

The majority of the Hund crews are composed of Quads, or quadruple amputees, wounded veterans and civilian volunteers who have been maimed and disfigured by the invading megafauna. Body modifications are sometimes necessary for final adjustments, but replacement limbs are provided. Quads came about originally from the Assault Raptor program, but have proved to be an invaluable asset in the fight against the invading monsters.
