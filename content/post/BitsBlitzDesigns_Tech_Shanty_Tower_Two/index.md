Description :

~~~
The Tech Shanty Tower One is designed for 6mm / 8mm games in mind. This kit includes two versions of the same structure (one with commercial signs that are flat, the other one with three dimensional signs). Also included are two signs that can be added on top of the building. If desired, you could always mount a turret of one of my [vehicle designs](https://cults3d.com/en/design-collections/BitsBlitzDesigns/smallscale-vehicles) on there as well

Dimensions (including signs etc that stick out): 36mm wide x 42mm deep x 62mm tall.
