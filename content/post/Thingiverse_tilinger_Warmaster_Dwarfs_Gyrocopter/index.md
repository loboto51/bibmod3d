Description :

~~~
A 10mm dwarf gyrocopter for Warmaster. Two rotor size variants, and a body with or without hole for a flying base, as well as one with a scenic base.

I’ve never been a fan of the currently available 10 mm gyrocopters. Maybe I’m biased — the sixth-edition model is the one I have in my Warhammer army, and I’ve always loved that design. So I decided to make one in that style for my Warmaster force as well. I was in a bit of a rush to finish it before my vacation, and the rotor didn’t quite get done in time — waiting a whole week just to add that part was tough.
