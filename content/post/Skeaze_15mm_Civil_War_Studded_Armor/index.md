Description :

~~~
The blasphemous civil war has spread across the galaxy, and some of the GMO super soldiers have decided to make armor held together by lots of big round studs...

Now includes 10 variants with assorted bolt guns, 10 with chain-bayonets, 10 with knifey-type bayonets, 5 flamethrowers, 5 melting guns, and 5 plasma guns. Blender files are also included.

These have been slightly altered, reproportioned, and assembled from various free files. As-is they are slightly taller (and a lot bulkier) than a normal 15mm model. They are approximately the same size and proportions as a Galactic Crusader scaled to 225%. If you want them "true scale" you should upscale them to about 110%.

Torsos: Cornivius
Arms & Legs: Blobby234
Helmets: Mildseven
Backpacks: Fummelfinger & Milje
Guns: Fummelfinger, MKHand_Industries

I'll probably add bayonet options and maybe some more poses in the near future!
