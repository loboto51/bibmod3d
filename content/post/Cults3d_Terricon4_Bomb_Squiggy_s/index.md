Description :

~~~
A little group of explosive toting squiggies, ill informed as to the nature of the presents they were given and what will happen once they deliver them. Useful as tokens for various types of hobby games, or just as a fun little piece for your projects or other models bases.
Made to pair with some of my other kits/projects posted here, mainly demolition boyz, and squig catapulting buggy.

Scaled for use on 25mm bases by default. Files include both supported and unsupported.
