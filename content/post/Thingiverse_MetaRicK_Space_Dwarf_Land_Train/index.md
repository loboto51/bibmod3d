Description :

~~~
Inspired by the new Votann (return of the squats ;-) i had a reason to finally paint my classic squats in combination with new Votann as one big army.
Being an Epic player with a big Squat army, i also wanted to have a land train for both my squats in 40k and for Necromunda, for that is where squats live.
The Space Dwarf Land Train from taaz was a good basis and from there i made a Land Train 2.0 that i tried to give a post-squat and pre-votann vibe.

I upgraded the train-cars with printable tracks and more details (doors, windows, exhaust pipes, new towbars). Then i added runes to get several different looking train-cars.
Furthermore i made new train-car tops because i wanted a different (lower) height and a more detailed weapon design.

Finally and most importantly i completely redesigned the train engine.
It now also is a playable piece of terrain and has details that fit a model this size in 40k.
The sides are based on the sides from the original from taaz, also as a tribute/thanks, but the rest is redesigned from the ground up.

All STL are tested/printed in 40k scale (0.2mm 15% infill) and printable, most of them supportless.
