Description :

~~~
Originally produced by Games Workshop for their 6mm scale table top wargame, Epic 40,000 (and precessors/successors). They have since abandoned all support for Epic, so I modeled this in Autodesk Inventor for any avid wargamers.

Scaled to match the FW model, so it is considerably larger than the official GW models.

Epic has been re-released as a titans-only game called Adeptus Titanicus. It is nominally 8mm scale instead of 6mm, so I suggest that anyone wanting to print this for AT scenery or to play 8mm Epic should upscale it by 125%.
