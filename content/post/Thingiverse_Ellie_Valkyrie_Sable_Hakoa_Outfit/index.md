Description :

~~~
I love the game SABLE by SHEDWORKS. It's probably my favorite game, and a really under-rated gem. This is my tribute to the game, and to the fans of game who, like me, have wanted a little physical model of Sable for their shelves or desks. 

The Hakoa top and bottom are my favorite pieces of clothing in the game, so I created this version of Sable dressed in them. I've included two versions, one with the iconic Ibexii mask and one with the Scrapper mask, which is how Sable appears in my playthrough (screenshot attached.)

She's scaled for 28mm gaming, but you can also scale her up to any size that you like.

I really, really hope that we get to see more of SABLE's world in the future. It's really an amazing experience of a game.
