Description :

~~~
Based on Loggyk's excellent Retro Renegade parts. They have been reproportioned to be close to the proportions of Moonjam's Galactic Crusaders, and scaled down to 15mm. I've included the .blend file if you want to do your own customization.

As is they are a few millimeters taller than a normal 15mm human (equivalent to a Galactic Crusader at 225%). If you want them to be more "true scale" (equivalent to GC's at 250%) you should scale them up 111%.

Chaingun is by MKHand_Industries

I might try to add additional heavy weapon options, if I can or modify them.
