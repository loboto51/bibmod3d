Description :

~~~
Some Boss-Orks.

They were made as Ork Marauders for the Grim Dark Future tabletop game, but they can be used as proxys for any wargame.

If you like my models consider leaving a tip :)

Remixed parts:
Ork Infantry by VidovicArts
Ork Ladz Heads and Arms by assaultsloth
Ork shoulder plates bits by rs_77
WAAAGH banna - ork totem - gubbin by jimjimjimmyjimis
Orc Weapon Set by Polarcupz

For the real experience, print them with pink filament and apply clear coat. But that's up to you.
