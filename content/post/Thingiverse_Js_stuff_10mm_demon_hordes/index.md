Description :

~~~
Demon hordes for warmaster both with and without supports using Duncan Shadow's awesome demons.

10mm demon army
See my collections for the other units; I have a unit for each of the roles in warmaster revolution and a couple of heroes. Note that this army does not inherently match one of the big four chaos gods by design, as I find them dreadfully boring.

Supports
The supports are auto generated by Prusa. The strips are densely supported, but I haven't had any failures. The worst that's happened is me breaking off an arm of one of the demons on the edges of the strip when impatiently clipping through the supports.

Why?
I just got a 3d printer and was looking to get into warmaster with some friends when I noticed that there is no ready to print demon army yet. Given my 0-level modelling skills I instead decided to use existing models to create the army; this unit is one of the outcomes of this project.

Disclaimer
To be sure: none of these models are actually mine. I am a complete hack blundering his way through blender; all I can do is resize models, fatten segments and add cylinders (you may spot some of my handiwork on other models).
