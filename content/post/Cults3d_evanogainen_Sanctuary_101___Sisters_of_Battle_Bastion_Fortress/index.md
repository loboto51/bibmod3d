Description :

~~~
Recreation of the Sisters Of Battle Sanctuary 101 scenery from White Dwarf/Witch Hunters Codex.

*** STILL IN PROGRESS ***

So far I've done the main window walls and buttresses.
The roof/floor, dome and upper rampart walls are blank placeholders for now. they will fit but they are not detailed yet.
I have yet to add the door.

But this is now a buildable structure.

The buttresses are designed at 3 different angles so you can build more than just the octagonal building it's based from. You should be able to combine this kit into most shapes with the walls joining either straight, 45 degrees or 90 degrees and some straight floor sections to help at the top too.

So more detail to come soon.
