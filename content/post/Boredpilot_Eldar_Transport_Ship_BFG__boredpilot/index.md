Description :

~~~
This is my version of the BFG Eldar Transport ship (I personally hate the original model as to me it looks like a cross of Eldar nose, imperial center, and dark eldar rear.)

2 Versions, there is the HEX pattern on the wing and a SMOOTH version.

This model is fairly close to the original model size at 40.7mm x 23.7mm x 13.4mm

The photo with the other sips are all in my cults for sale as well under different names, this shows well the scale of each of my models so far, this is JUST the Eldar transport ship, the tiny ship


This was printed in resin at 90 degrees (So the nose straight up, this minimized the amount of supports on the sails then) you may decide to print at a different angle but this worked well with my old resin printer (its not a mono or 4k, has dead pixels etc lol)
