Description :

~~~
Rigged version of an ork made by VidovicArts. I used this to create all my ork models so far. 

There are a some hidden parts in the file and lots of poses in the pose library of the rig. My workflow with this is as follows:

-Add objects like torsi an weapons to the file an pot them to the right place at the body
-hide all parts you don't need for your boi
-make copy of the rig, the body and all parts you added
-parent all objects to the rig (as objects to specific bones)
-choose a pose from the pose library or create a new one.
-apply all modifiers to the parts
-unparent all objects while keeping their transformation
-boolean unite all objects 
-use windows 3D builder to repair any problems in the mesh
-print
