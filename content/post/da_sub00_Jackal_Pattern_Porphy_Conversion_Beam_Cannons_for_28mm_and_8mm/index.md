Description :

~~~
Printable Heavy Beamers to arm your Porphy with to make use of it as a counts as Aster. Included are suitable files for both 8mm and 28mm Scale Grimdark kits.

Any parts with the mirror tag mean you need to mirror a copy for the opposite arm fitout. To make a complete pair of arms you will need to print out the mirrored parts plus a second copy of the unmirrored parts.

Note because of the tight fit I couldn't quite get the body side cabling to fit without hitting other parts of the model so I recommend leaving them off.

Printed out fine on my Photon at 0.03mm and on my Saturn at 0.05mm in Monocure Rapid Gunmetal.

30/06/2021: Added the 28mm scale armour mount that had been missed in the mass upload.

06/06/2021:
Added the Following:
Two types of Hull Volkites for converting the Porphy into an Aster Proxy. 
Type A - Replaces the hull weapon mount entirely.
Type B - Easy to use magnets in the ball socket allowing you to freely swap between the lascannon and autocannon

07/07/2021
Added Supported Versions of the 8mm Scale Parts suitable for printing on Photon/Mars Sized Printers (Superfine Supports). Includes Hull Beamer Type A, Armour and Main Beamer Body.

21/01/2024 
Added the unsupported Shoulder Platelate for 8mm as a customer let me know I had forgotten to include it.
