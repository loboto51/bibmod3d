Description :

~~~
+++ The individuals known as Grand Warlords are rarely seen, appearing only in the largest of battles where their great tactical skill and commanding presence are necessary to control a vast army of countless soldiers and monstrous war engines. The title itself is temporary, lasting for the duration of the campaign and generally being awarded to a warlord who stands out above the rest due to his martial achievements, although it is also possible that the Stronghold Lord himself is the one who wears the powerful Exo-armor distinctive of the Great Warlord. However, although it grants great honor and renown, it is a position that implies tremendous responsibility that not everyone is willing to assume or able to fulfill, and for a Great Warlord defeat in battle means ruin and contempt for his clan for generations.

The Living Ancestors are the oldest individuals in Squat society, who form the basis of their religion. For all intents and purposes, the Living Ancestors have abandoned their previous life and identity and are now regarded as vessels of the spirits of the deceased, who observe and judge all the actions of the Squats.  In battle they provide wisdom and advice for leaders, and physical support for warriors, because their long life (or perhaps also due to the influence of spirits) has allowed them to develop psychic powers which focus on defense and healing, but they are not completely incapable of attacking if they are forced to do so, although with much disgust. +++


These are a Epic scale Squat Grand Warlord and a Living Ancestor for the Grindel Sronghold army list that you can find here: https://tacticalwargames.net/taccmd/viewtopic.php?f=134&t=33281&sid=422418b4bea515739e1aef8d862588e5

They are considered characters, which means that they do not form individual units but must join an existing one. As you can see in the photos, I attached them to a Warlord unit, because I think it makes sense, but they are not restricted to this unit only.
