2018-10-15 - I suppose it's a good way of spending the time with a stinking cold. Added the pointy prow and a modified spine for the Desolator class et al.

2019-04-21 - Added a stem hole on the rear hull, and added a picture of the angry Christmas tree prow.

2019-06-04 - Fixed the break between the bridge and the main body of the upper hull (hopefully) Thanks AmonTriskel!

2020-03-11 - Added whole models split up for very large prints (split into four parts, with weapons bays)

2020-03-26 - Added a new bridge variant and uploaded all the permutations of bridge and spine
