Description :

~~~
15mm space jarheads wearing the classic "eagle" armor. Included are 6 different shoulder mounted heavy weapons. Huge props to Toftylicious for the heavy weapons!

Various free parts have been meticulously pulled apart, resized, reproportioned, altered, or remodeled myself. Then reassembled and posed. They have been made to match the proportions of the famous 8mm "Galactic Crusaders", but with much more detail.

These guys are 17-18mm at the eye, or 19-20mm at the top of the head.

Credits:
Toftylicious for the heavy weapons!!!
