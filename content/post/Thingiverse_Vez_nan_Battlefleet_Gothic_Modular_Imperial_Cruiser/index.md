Description :

~~~
My take on the standard imperial cruisers for battlefleet gothic.

This design is intentionally very close to the original sculpts, though some creative liberties were taken.

All parts have holes for 1x2 mm round magnets so they can be easily magnetized.

WARNING: This project is still heavily WIP. The tolerances on some of the modular parts are a bit off and they may require some force to assemble. It is currently recommended to just glue the head and ram in place, and only magnetize the weapons. If the scale seems wrong on a part, try scaling it up or down by a factor of 10.

ImperialCruiserComplete.stl represents a Lunar-class cruiser.

Improved versions of all parts, more complete cruisers, a main body variant for battlecruisers and nova cannons are all hopefully coming soon.
