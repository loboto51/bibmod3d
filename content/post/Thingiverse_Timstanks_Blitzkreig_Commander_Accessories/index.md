Description :

~~~
Here is a collection of pieces I have designed as accessories for playing the Blitzkreig Commander (BKC) series of wargames rules. They are designed for 10/12mm scale, but can easily be shrunk/enlarged to suit 6mm or 15mm scale.

There are;-
- 180' arc of fire template (Tanks etc)
- 90' arc of fire template (SPGs etc)
- Artillery Template (200mm diameter)
- 3 types of bases to suit infantry sections, support weapons & field guns - these are bevelled edged (like FoW bases) with a recessed to allow for basing material hiding figure bases and have a hole to take a 7mm dice to indicate hits.
- Simple Dug-In markers to match the above
- Smoke screen piece to mark where smoke has been fired
- Burning tank markers  to indicate destroyed AFVs
- Mortar/Artillery burst markers to indicate where fire has landed
- 'S' counters to mark units who have been supressed
- 'O' counters to mark units that have taken opportunity fire.

All have been printed on a Creality Ender 5 Pro using PLA at 210'c and bed temperature of 60'c. I tend to add a brim just for security, but probably not really needed.

If you can think of anything else we need to play BKC let me know! Enjoy!!
