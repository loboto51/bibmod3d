Description :

~~~
Imperial cruisers and escort for Microfleet Gothic. Files will be expanded upon over time (only one battleship, no grand or light cruisers, and not all cruisers present at the time of posting).

Original files primarily from Italianmoose. Say thanks by giving him a tip!

Bases and guidelines for playing the game at 1/2 scale can be found here: 
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4459459

Edited 25 June 2020: Added the Dauntless, Defiant, Endeavor and Endurance light cruisers. Files from Italianmoose, MKHand, and Tsubureru.

Edit II 25 June 2020: Added Apocalypse, Emperor, Oberon, Victory, Vanquisher and Retribution battleships; designs by Italianmoose.

Edit 27 June 2020: Replaced all battleships added on 25 June due to some idiot having accidentally rescaled the magnet adapter. Current versions are 'v2'.
