Description :

~~~
**These are proxy models for an existing game system and are not intended for use as permanent replacements for their legitimate game model counterparts.**

These holy ladies march into battle with shield and halberd, ready to purge heretics with bolter and blade.

There are **five** different poses, both with a helmeted and non-helmeted variant.  There are also four backpacks, however, they are all identical with the exception of purity seals, so you may use any backpack with any Sister.

Now also included:  Sisters 1-5 A pre-supported
Also included: Sisters 1-5B with maces, a remix of mine by another and lost to the void.

If you have any questions, shoot me an email!

Also, **For Printing:**  Just rotate the model back (typically 45 degrees) and add auto-supports using light supports.  I did mine at 50% density because I love supports, and I have had no print issues.  One spot to look out for is the magazine on the bolt pistol, however.  I found that it was not supported on Sacresant 1 during my test print and the bottom of the magazine was warped slightly.

Lastly, big thanks to:
 -Jimsbeanz who's armor designs were the base of the torsos and legs.
-Oldgez who released shield designs just in time to save me the trouble of making them myself.
