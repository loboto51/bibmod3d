Description :

~~~
A kitbash based on an Overlord model, turrets changed and a Nova cannon added.


Printing went well after a few minor adjustments. The second version of the file had a few design modifications.


The model is pre-drilled for a 4 mm aluminum or brass rod.





23/10/24


Small corrections to the base file, deletion of a few cavities and scale increased by 10%.


The Nova cannon, a pain in the ass to install supports, has been changed and is now much nicer in terms of supports.
