Description :

~~~
Something I've made on couple of weeks ago on few free evenings. I wanted to upload it when I've test printed it but could not find a moment to do it so here it is. 

It always bothered me that mechanicum leaves so much flesh on their tools of war when head is just enough. It is my version of Kataphron Destroyer with it's standard weapons. It should be roughly the same size as the original.

Most parts should print fairy well with default orientation and supports. Weapons might need to be sliced in half.
