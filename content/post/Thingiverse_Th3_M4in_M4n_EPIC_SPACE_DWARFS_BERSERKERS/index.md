Description :

~~~
+++ Berserks units are made up from assault squads of the mos ferocious hand-to-hand fighters in the Stronghold. Armed with bolt pistols and power axes, theyre experts tunnel fighters and excel at clearing buildings and fortifications ahead of the Brotherhood´s advance. All squats are doughty fighters in close combat, but the Berserks units are renowed for their tneacity and courage against even the mightiest opponents without thought for their own looses.

By tradition, Berserkers often wear a striking crest dyed bright red, which is why they refuse to wear combat helmets. The origins of this practice have been lost in the mists of time, but what for many Imperial officers could be an absurd and tactically reprehensible risk, for the Squats is definitive proof of the courage of the Berserkers and their attitude of always spitting in death´s face.+++

I have had these models ready for quite some time, and in fact I also have them printed, but due to lack of time I have not been able to mount and paint them properly to take nice pics.

As I am currently focused on finishing my squat miners (among other lesser things such as graduating from university), I don't think I will resume my Epic Squats in the short term, so I have decided to upload these Berserkers models once and for all and thus finish the infantry forces at least.

Finally this guys come in two flavours: with a boltpistol/power axe combo, and the classic dual wield boltpistols. This is a simple aestetic choice to give variety to the squads.
