Description :

~~~
The frigates employed by Imperial space marines are larger than their standard navy counterparts, but while similar in armament their speed allow them to run down escaping craft that are too powerful for the smaller destroyers to handle. 

Comes with a 3mm hole to accept standard GW flying stands. Perfect for games of Battlefleet Gothic and other space combat games. Merely good for representing orbital support for games of Epic: Armageddon and other 6mm scale mass-wargames. Uses the turrets from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2813536
