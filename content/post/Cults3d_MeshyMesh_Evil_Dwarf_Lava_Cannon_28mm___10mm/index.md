Description :

~~~
Evil Dwarfs without cannons is heresy! 
Light the forges and take these lava cannons out to wreak a bit of vengeance or fun.

Files come pre-supported and unsupported.
Includes 10mm version which can be printed as one with individual crew.

Comes with three crew as separate prints.
*21/09/23 ADDED: three new crew, see picture. They have their own zip and come supported and unsupported*

*21/09/23 ADDED: alternative cannon. This one has an angled cannon, lava sculpt changed, alternative motif on cannon. Comes supported and unsupported. The other parts like the platform can of course still be used with this alternative too.

Two types of levers which you can push into the holes found on the cannon. Print a few of each to mix and match.

Also comes with a lava cannon firing accessory. Useful if you want more than one cannon and want a bit of variety (you need more than one!). Recommendation is to print, fit and then cure.

Flame on!
