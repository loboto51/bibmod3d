Description :

~~~
Took J4ROID's "Little DNA Borrowers Kit" to produce a set of completed models.  The original parts were beautifully sculpted, however, every set of parts were scaled differently to various incorrect proportions.  Corrected these issues, added a couple of small changes here and there, and added debris for them to stand on in order to strengthen their bond to bases when glued down.
