Description :

~~~
UPDATE: Found there was some geometry present in heads 1 and 2 for each type that may present problems, so I went through and cleaned it out. If you printed these with resin before, should be wary of little pockets of resin within the mouth. New ones do not have these voids.

There are a lot of orcish heads about this website, but I wanted to make my own. I started by putting together some shapes, mostly toruses and squished spheres, in the general form I wanted compared to available orcish heads, and then sculpted the finer details, until I was happy enough to make multiple expressions from it.

I couldn't settle on a specific nose or teeth type, so I decided to use both in extra combos with all the facial expressions I sculpted, resulting in twenty, 20, different head combinations.

I wanted something that could be used for a number of orcish plans I have coming up, something that could work for more warfam figures that I may produce. Panzerfauste, the fantasy ww2 with british orcs, is a game these could be used for.

Have fun with them and be creative all!
