Description :

~~~
New model from my crazy meks. Recommended for resin printers.

Photos for instance. Model is separeted in to parts - all parts in zip archive. 

There are couple types of guns - choose one you like. For rocket luncher - rockets not included (you can find some in my tankbustaz conversion kit)

Fits nicely to a 40mm round base.

There is neck on a body for reason - glue there some ork head and you'll get a meganob (dont tell this to G W or they'll ban this model)


Thanks, Enjoy!
~~~
