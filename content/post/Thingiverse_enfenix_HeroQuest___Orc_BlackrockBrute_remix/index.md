Description :

~~~
Here is a new WoW-Heroquest Crossmix.
I actually want to try to split the orc so that I can do better poses in Sculptris.

There are some minimal self intersecting surfaces i couldn't fix yet. Cura can handle it pretty well. But i have no experience with other slicers.

General information

My miniatures are designed to work out of the box with original 28mm Heroquest miniatures.
I always add a version with Heroquest base and one without a base. The weapons and the base are only combined (if possible).
Personally, I now prefer 32mm miniatures. I usually scale them to 112% -115% directly in the slicer.

I am happy about every shared make, especially the painted ones.
By the way i love espresso, so don't hesitate to leave a tip if you like =D

If you are inexperienced with slicer setting, I recommend this one for Ender Printer: http://www.fatdragongames.com/fdgfiles/?p=4934
