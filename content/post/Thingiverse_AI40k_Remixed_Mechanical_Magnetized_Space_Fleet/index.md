Description :

~~~
Here's a fully remixed fleet for the Mechanical Spaceships - full credit to Italianmoose for creating such an amazing set of models.

Why a remix? I've cleaned up the files a fair bit and added some nice extras to make them more practical for the tabletop.

All options are magnetized - 2x1mm holes for Prow and Weapons Battery choices. Each option has been designed to be WYSIWYG - torpedo tubes, matching lance/weapons batteries from the rulebook to make any combination.

All Hulls are magnetized for 4x2mm flight stands which I've also included - this is perfect for keeping them stable without any issues, tried and tested!

Each hull has an "Embossed" set of prows and hulls. This is so you can choose to have logos or not.

"The Nova Cannons are underslung?!" Yes. I struggled to get them to fit correctly in a way I was happy with. Included are Stock prows and separate Nova Cannon files if you want to add them on yourself, and in the future I may add them as additional files.

[UPDATE 12/9/20] Added Armored Prow Pack (LC rules allow an upgraded prow at the cost of mobility, why not roll them out for all options! Once again significantly modified from Italianmoose base files for Imperial Battleships.)
