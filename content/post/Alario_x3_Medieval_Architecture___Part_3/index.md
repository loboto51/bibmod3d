Description :

~~~
The scale is 28mm: The models are made in 28 mm scale, but they can be easily scaled to meet your needs.
Handmade: All models have been hand sculpted to achieve the best detail and quality.
Optimized for Printing: Buildings are pre-cut for easy printing on standard FDM printers (such as Ender 3, Prusa, etc.).
Assembly Slots: The models are equipped with connecting and leveling pins for easy assembly.
Printing Recommendations: You can use both FDM and SLA printers to print the main parts of buildings
I am grateful for your support!

In this project, every small element of the village has been thought out to create an atmosphere of the Middle Ages and the feeling that you are in this era. You will be able to print and assemble each building together, creating a unique composition that will become a worthy decoration of your interior or playing field.

Do not miss the opportunity to purchase this unique project and plunge into the world of medieval architecture and atmosphere!
