Description :

~~~
Small and Mean, and you can crank them out by the bushel!

The Basic Raptor in 15mm Tabletop (1/100th scale) is a starter model, a free demonstration of both the scale and the detail of my files.  It can also make an easy desktop display model, without taking up too much room.

Depending on pose, height on the included 50mm base is about 2 and 5/8th inch, or 66.6mm.

If you would like the free 28mm (1/56th scale) version, click here...

------------------------

Kushal Heavy Industries, based 214 jumps deep in the Fourth Gate Network of worlds, is a renowned manufacturer of arms, both for their economy of material usage and rock bottom pricing structures.

They recently have taken their surrounding upstream and downstream neighborhood of dimensions by storm with the release of the Basic Raptor, a clean-sheet refinement of the datacore salvaged long ago from an unknown, nuked-out world.

That datacore gave the Realms Project Raptor, a broad category of light mechs that serve as scouts and fast attack platforms, taking the fight to the enemy with speed and devastating firepower.

Kushal's version is a stark, bare-bones battle platform that is intended for the customer who needs to put warheads on foreheads, without any need for frivolity, pomp, or circumstance.  Or cockpit padding, as many a bruised pilot can testify.

The Basic Raptor is sneered at by some, but admired by others for its uncompromising simplicity, ruggedness, and singularity of purpose.

Many smaller defense contractors and boutique armor shops are taking stock Basic Raptors and modifying them with fancier weapons and armor packages. Assassins from the Kushal Heavy Industries Legal Department have been dispatched through the world-gates to deliver enhanced cease-and-desist notifications, to some lethal effect.
