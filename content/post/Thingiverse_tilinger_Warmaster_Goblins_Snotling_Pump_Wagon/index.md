Configurable Snotling Pump Wagon for Warmaster. Converted from a couple of different stls.

Edit: reuploaded the cart and the walls. Only noticed after importing them into Chitubox, that some normals are flipped.

Edit 2: oh my, the blades collided with the walls, so assembling would have required some knife-work. Until now, that is, there is a fixed cart stl. Also my first print of the roof was quite warped, so there you have a version with a support. I recommend removing them after curing.
