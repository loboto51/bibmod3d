Description :

~~~
This is a Painting Handle for epic-scaled miniatures!
The orange lever can be thrown to rotate the minis 90 degrees.
This allows you to have them in close rows, saving space, and allowing for efficient spraying, without sacrificing the ability to paint the side details!

This model is designed to be printed via FDM. If you don't have one, don't worry! I'll be printing them through my etsy, here:
https://etsy.me/3PB8q07

The handle is light, stable, and modular!

Use:
Basic Configuration: Put 5x Basic Gears in the handle and then a set of the two racks. You want to make sure one is at the top of it's travel, and the other is as far down as it can go. See the pictures for an example of how it should look.

The holder is designed that the gears are slightly taller than they ought to be. This means that the lid pushes down onto the gears to create enough friction and tension that the gears don't tilt around during painting. If you want to relieve a bit of tension to make the mechanism easier to operate, I've found that gently bending the lid outwards to relieve this tension helps.

Threaded Gears: The Threaded gears can be swapped in to allow the fitment of the Holder plates - these can be used for pinned minis using the central hole and a bit of superglue to hold it's rotation, or minis with a wider footprint.

Stackable Base and Lid: These are the regular base and lid but with a second hole so you can print a mirrored rack with handle, to allow for easier actuation of the mechanism. 
This also means that you can line up the handles along your desk, nesting the switch nub into the hole of the painting handle in front, useful for keeping everything tidy and together when batchpainting or spraying!
For an example, check out the last two photos, for how the nesting works!
