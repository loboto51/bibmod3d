Description :

~~~
I have been working on some ships to be used as proxies for necrons in the now OOP game of space combat in the 41st millennium, BFG. I have two more to complete, but until then here are the first three. The Jackal is scaled down from the one I posted previously. If you would like it larger, you can get that one here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3998233

There are small pilot holes drilled in the underside for convenience. You can of course ignor them and put the hole where you wish. I also do not recommend printing the complete Shroud Cruiser. It is slapped together just to demonstrate how it goes together. Enjoy!

I have zipped everything together for download just in case the verse of things decides that it cannot zip them for you. :)
