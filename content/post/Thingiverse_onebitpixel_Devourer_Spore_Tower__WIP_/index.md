Description :

~~~
Updated; added; tyranid_devourer_center_hollow_tendrils.stl; this has tendril feelers on all appendages; includes a slight half-sphere hollow underneath.

Update; added mirrored tower

Update; 2x new towers/chimney added; it just fits the print bed on the Afinia... barely, you'll have to rotate along the z-axis. I believe I'll have to scale the one that is completely upright, it may be possible that I'll split that file so it can be printed large enough and in multiple pieces...

Updated: image and STL file; devourer_center was printed at 85% in size.

Work-in-Progress; CCW - Dune/Alien/Tyranid Terrain (lets mashup our sci-fi genres)
Can be used as capillary towers and spore chimney

Devourer_center should be reduced/scaled based on how large you want the mandible/towers. I might end up removing the talons mashed from the Ethereal Marauder and do something different... other files to follow as they get successfully printed.

Bases print hollowed; two reasons are to reduce filament and print time; however, you could also chuck in a 6 sided dice, shake it up and set it on the table.  If one of the towers/mandibles is destroyed you lift it up and see what number is revealed and that is how many termagants are generated to come and defend the objective... anyone have any Megarachnids hanging around, lol.

Working on adding more shaping/detailing/muscle, tissue and pits/boils; possibly adding a "mouth" at the top of the spires/towers.  Might also be usable as a basis for Tyrannocyte/Sporocyst model...

Not sure about scale/proportions but will play around with it; I currently use Heroscape Marro Hives and old Battle For Macragge bits, so those are starting reference points for scale. 

The tower design is basically repeated/scaled/modular, so it's possibly to make them larger if they are truncated so you can fit it together from large base to smaller top...
