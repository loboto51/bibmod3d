Description :

~~~
2 10mm Empire wizards for Warmaster, both supported and unsupported.

These have been designed for resin printing, with #1 printing and the supported version of #2 being ready to print as is. I have NOT test printed them yet, but it should print with no issue.

Thank you to BriteMinis for the base model, jimjimjimmyjim for the hammer, and MeneerMark for the base.
