Description :

~~~
This set contains 5 models in 15/18mm/1:100 scale.* All models are Pre-supported!**

There are 3 troopers equipped with wrist mounted "Injector 
Rifles", 1 with a "Spark Rifle" (shoots chain lighting), and 1 with a wrist mounted Compact Smolder rifle (could double as a plasma gun, or other energy weapon in for other games).

I made these with The Apex faction in mind, but obviously you can use them however you want.

Mystic Space is a newly released game by Nordic Weasel Games/Ivan Sorensen. These figures are released under version 1.00 of the Mystic Space Commercial License. You can get the alpha version of the rules here:
https://www.wargamevault.com/product/521390/Mystic-Space-Alpha-version?src=hottest

*These models are very much "Heroic Scale". These ultra heavies especially are BIG. The "Star Born" are taller than humans on average in Mystic Space lore, and on top of that these guys are wearing super heavy power armor. They're about 17-18mm at the eyes, and the top of their armored carapace tops out at about 22-23mm.

**I test print all my pre-supported files. I tend to go with more supports to be safe. I'd recommend using the hot-water technique to ensure easy support removal.
