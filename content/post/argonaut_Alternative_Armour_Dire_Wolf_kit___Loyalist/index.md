Description :

~~~
‘Isurus pattern’ Dire Wolf Titan armour, Loyalist allegiance, made to fit the LI/Adeptus Titanicus Dire Wolf Titan.

This is a full set of armour plates, to give your Dire Wolf titans a whole new look.

Are you a follower of the Warmaster? Then you’ll want the traitor version here:
https://cults3d.com/:2909778

Looking for a version with a plain, unaligned trim? Then go here:
https://cults3d.com/:2909807

This is a complete kit, replacing all of the armour plates.
Please note that, to utilise the carapace plate(s), you will need to cut GW part 21, just behind the vent, to remove the original carapace plate from the rest of this part before assembling the titan skeleton. Rest assured, it's a very simple cut - see the final photos for reference.

Included are 2 versions of the carapace, split and unsplit. The file '...unsplit' is the carapace in a single piece. The 3-part version is made up of 2 files, '...side' (which you copy and mirror) and '...top'.
The finished carapaces are exactly the same. Printing is faster with the split version (not so tall on the build plate) and tends to give a better surface finish (orientation to build plate). The unsplit version takes longer but, as it's a single piece, is much more robust and easier to swap in and out on your titan.

Most parts feature magnet holes, for either 2mm dia or 5x2x0.5mm magnets, giving the option of painting multiple versions for parts that you can swap in and out. Many can grip to the titan frame without the need for magnets (thigh plate and unsplit carapace feature holes, but you may well find you don't really need them. Shoulder plates on the other hand would need magnetising to be swappable). You'll need to add the appropriate reciprocal magnet holes/magnets to your titan skeleton to make use of these.

Files included: STL, pre-supported STL and Lychee scenes of each part (in the ZIP file) - should you want/need to tweak the supports for your particular printer.

Notes:
This is for the 8mm, AT2018/LI version only and is scaled appropriately for this size.
STLs and supported STLs are for left side versions only of the engine cover, shoulder, shin and thigh plates. These should be copied and mirrored to produce the right side plates (Shin plate is symmetrical, so can just copied), when printing your full set - though the '...full set' Lychee scene included in the ZIP file has this already set up for you. This full set scene utilises the 3-part version of the carapace, so swap these out for the 'unsplit' carapace if you want to print the single piece version with the rest of the parts.
