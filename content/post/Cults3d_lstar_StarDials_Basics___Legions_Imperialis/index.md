Description :

~~~
*Love playing games with hidden orders but hate faffing around with flimsy carboard tokens? 
Streamline your games of Legions Imperialis (or Epic!) with these X-Wing-style order dials! 
Just add two 3x2mm neodymium magnets and get scheming!*

Note: This is a bit of an open beta for dial designs I've been working on recently.
If other people like these as much as I do, I'll release a full range, covering other games, and fancy designs to suit various factions and armies.
Let me know how you get on printing these, if you run into any problems, or have any suggestions for making them better!


**How should I print these?**

These dials are supported for easy and high-quality vertical printing on a resin printer.
Unsupported versions are included in case this doesn't suit you.

Aligned vertically, layer height is more important for fine detail than your printer's XY resolution, so these designs should print nicely even on older printers! I recommend using a 0.03mm layer height.

**How should I remove these weird supports?**

Like other supports, warm them up with some warm water or a heat gun before removal. Wiggle the supports back and forth and they should pop off.

In most cases this should leave next to no support marks, but if a small amount of material is left on the disc, rub them gently with some sandpaper, or scrape them with a knife/mouldline remover.

**Why are there 5 versions of the lower discs? Aren't they exactly the same?**

This is to prevent any mentats or Alpha Legion infiltrators you happen to play against from trying to predict your orders by analysing icon or support mark orientation!

**Any painting tips?**

Option 1: Paint the dials and use a pinwash to pick out the symbols and text. Oil washes work great for this!

Option 2: Paint the dials and drybrush/overbrush the raised surfaces with another colour, leaving your original colour in the recesses.

**Any tips for reducing wear and tear?**

These things are going to get handled, tossed about and rubbed together over the course of a game!

I recommend giving your paint plenty of time to fully dry unjoined before use, and to apply a good coat of varnish!

**Are you going to make a version for my favourite army/game system?**

Yep, I've already designed dials for other games like Epic, Battlefleet Gothic and Aeronautica Imperialis, and themes for a number of popular armies. If the feedback for this pack is good, I'll release others in due course!

**I don't want to wait. Can I make my own versions?**

Sure, feel free to remix the Blank version for personal use.
