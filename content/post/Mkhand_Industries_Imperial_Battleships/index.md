Description :

~~~
Like the smaller cruisers, the Imperial Navy's battleships are usually built around a modular hull. Able to mount city flattening weapons, these ships of the line can be made order in almost any configuration a well-connected admiral desires.

Originated from the same steam workshop page as the Imperial Cruisers. Comes with a 3mm hole to fit the flying stand or mount of your choice. Uses the same weapon options from the Imperial Cruisers. Good for Battlefleet Gothic and Epic Armageddon.
