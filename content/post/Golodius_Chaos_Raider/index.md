Description :

~~~
In the heat of battle, it's sometimes necessary to salvage enemy equipment, even wreckage, and recondition it to make it usable again, and why not use your own damaged ships to reassemble everything into something usable.


That's what's on offer here. The Magos of the Dark Mechanicum always take great pleasure in corrupting and reusing imperial technology so that they can use it against the imperium.





The design isn't mine, it's a kitbash of several parts from Italianmoose for the hulls and Keiler for the turrets.





A 2.00mm slot is provided for fixing it to a base with a rod of any kind.





I haven't printed it yet, but a make will be posted as soon as possible.
