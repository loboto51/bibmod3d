Description :

~~~
I decided to make some extra chonky boys inspired by the "Civil War Studded" armor style. I've included bodies, heads, shoulder pads, and weapons scaled and reproportioned for 15mm. I also included some empty hands so you can add other additional weapons.

I didn't want to do every weapon combination, so you'll have to do a little assembling.

I rescaled, proportioned and plugged the fiddley gaps on Fummelfingers excellent "Big Rivet Gun" builder to work better at the smaller scale. The modified blender file is included.

I didn't include arms and power fists, but you can just use these scaled down to 55%:
