Description :

~~~
Update:
To fulfil request by Pass150787 added alternate versions so that every turret has a with or without attached missile pod.

An updated version of the classic Tiny MBT with all currently available turret options (with some variations because I like making things) including:
Classic Cannon
Plasma Cannon (With Variants)
Microwave Cannon
Melty Cannon (With Variants)
Beam Laser
Twin Laser Cannon
Twin Gatling
Flamer
Conversion Cannon
Gravity Cannon

These have been designed for use at 15mm and using 4x2mm magnets.
Designed based on 6mm models and resized to suit 15mm, if you wanted to use these at a smaller scale then at 50% and using 2x1mm magnets they will likely work quite well for 8mm scale.
I have included both Hollow and Solid versions of the main chassis, the Hollow I have test printed and it has come out fine, the solid is included for anyone that wants to shrink them down.
To make best use of this tank you will want to use it with my Tiny Tank Commanders and Sponsons found here:
