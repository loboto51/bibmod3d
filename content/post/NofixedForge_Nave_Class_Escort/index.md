Dark Cathedral Fleet - Nave Class Escort

Scaled to be a similar size to Battlefleet gothic ships or similar table top games. These will fill the role of the BFG chaos escort.

1 x Hull
6 x Turrets/ Masts

READY WITH A HOLE FOR A 2MM FLIGHT STAND THAT IS FAIRLY STANDARD. CAN INSTEAD BE FITTED WITH A 4MM MAGNET IF YOU MAGNETISE YOUR STANDS.
(I do have a free stand download but there are loads to pick from. The ones with a brass rod are a free download on my profile.)

FOR PERSONAL USE, NOT FOR RESALE AS A DIGITAL FILE OR PRINTED COPIES

EDIT:
22/09/23: Small Triple turret had an off centre peg. Have corrected.
