Description :

~~~
Our biggest project is alive!


The challenge was to create a AT scale and a 40K scale hyperdetailed Imperator titan remix.


- The model is a remix from only public or free STLs so it can be shared freely


- The titan is inspired in the Titandeath novel cover, with flat upper platform and gothic style similar to the old classic Epic design.


- Size: 25 cms. for AT, for 40K, following FW scale, it should have a hight of 95-105 cms. so you should upscale the models at 400% or use the 40K scale version. You can upscale it up to 2mts to keep with the lore.


- The base used model is the old epic imperator model, a fantastic and totally accurate model from creator dantigibus you can find (yet) free on cults Here: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/titan-imperator


- The other base model is the imperator titan, modern-style, from creator zammerak you can find also free here in Cults: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/titanic-church-delivery-system


- The first part finished was the head, 40K scale with detailed interiors you can download here in Cults in my collection. This release features a AT scale head with no interiors.


- Inside the .zip file you can find a construction guide.





- If you want to know the history of this project, step by step, go to my web page: http://inquisitorweb.mygamesonline.org in the crazy mixer section.





- I'm trying to cut the 40K scale parts to fit Saturn printers. By now, the larger part fits in Saturn 2 printer. Some bigger ones could not fit in the old Saturn.





- Enjoy! and remember donations are always welcome! help us further development of this model.





WARNING! This is a very challenging model, only suitable for very experienced printers and modellers.





Users with a 8K printer may choose to use the 40K version for AT downscaling every part to -400%.





Changelog:





17-4-22: Reinforced the base of the platform down spires, they were too thin for printing in a 2K printer.


18-4-22: Rebuild the upper gun towers. Some people had issues printing them, so I,ve splitted each tower in 2 parts (3 for the back towers) and extra-repair both of them.


Now the problems seems to be solved.


24-4-22: Added 2 optional buildings, a tower bridge in front of the main basillica, and a curved bridge tower for the sides.


27-4-22: last updates, 2 small optional towers for the central place in the platform (place at your choice), replacement fences for the tiny torso fences (sides and back) and church circular fences that don't print well in 2K printers and also replacements for the tiny tower windows.


And as a reward only for my kindly donators, an optional landing pad for the back of the platform with a Arvus lighter included! Ask me for the parts.


27-8-22 Added a set of alternative arms for the main weapons, created by Andrew Killoch


30-10-22 Added a file with the ongoing 40K scale parts, WIP. just now only leg armour, feet and part of the bastion.


6-11-22 Added an alternative 2 parts splitted AT scale torso for smaller printers and uploaded the last leg parts in 40K scale. Now, the legs are complete in 40K scale. and made to the max detail limits my (rather old) computer allows me.


11-11-22 Plasma anihilator complete in 40K scale, find it in the 40K scale file.


20-11-22 Hellstorm cannon complete in 40K scale,find it in the 40K scale file.


3-12-22 Added the head for 40K scale, a revision from my Imperator head model in Cults, size reduced to fit the Imperator body to AT X 4, more detailed and with a simplified top with better fit with the lower middle parts. The head comes without crew.


Also in the main weapons folders you can find both arms (take care, they are different, not mirrors).


4-12-22 Added a 40K scale head variation with crew integrated (2 moderatii and 1 princeps) in the donators rewards folder.


14-12-22 Added a 40K scale Chaos head variant in the donators folder with demonic crew inside.


16-12-22 The 40K torso parts are complete! splitted to fit in a Saturn S or Saturn 2 printer. Added too an alternative part with a secret toaster repair dock in the donators folder. Enjoy!


18-12-22 Added the left feet missing parts (the feet part 4 isn't a mirror from the right one)


5-2-23 Plattform base in 40K scale released! with optional tower splitted parts. As usual parts are splitted to fit larger printers as Saturn 2.


5-3-23 Main cathedral, the first platform building finished!


20-3-23 Started painting the AT scale printed prototype


15-4-23 The Quake cannon Bastion, second platform bulding, finished


21-4-23 Next set of platform buildings ready in 40K scale: Volcano cannon tower and small side church (X2).


2-5-23 Finished the Optional rounded bridge in 40K scale with his rail AA gun and the optional small bridge too.


8-5-23 Last platform buldings finished: front and rear towers and side small tower. Also added in the donators rewards folder a new, remixed Arvus lighter and the optional rear landing platform in 40K scale.


9-5-23 Model finished!!!! yuhuuu!!! last 40K scale parts: the towers under the platform and the hips version 2 (without the emblematic dick cannon)


10-5-23 Added an optional right torso part 6 variant with mechanicum WC and amno rooms in the donators reward forlder.


17-5-23 Added an optional left torso part 4 variant with mechanicum vending machine in the donators reward forlder and repair some minor errors in front and rear towers lower parts (front tower part 1 and rear tower part 3)


19-5-23 Repaired some minor errors in left leg bastion part 3 and added some more details.
