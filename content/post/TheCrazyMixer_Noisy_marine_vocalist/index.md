Description :

~~~
The first in a series of remixed noise marines to form a complete noise chaos rock band.
This one is to be the vocalist of the band, so I started with a free, general chaos marine, add the retro-like microphone, a also retro-like sonic blaster and the noise backpack. Plus a lot of tiny chaotic decorations such as the severed head, Slaanesh icons, chaos sword etc.
The idea is a band of noise marines clearly in the show-bussines mood, and with a retro look. After all, chaos warriors must wish to have their own idols, true? and the daemonettes? what kind of photo posters do they have in their lair-rooms? that is.

This model is remixed all from free public models:

- For the main body I choose a classic chaos marine from JimsBeanz here in Cluts3D: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/chaos-space-warrior-with-chain-axe
- The Noise backpack: I choose this free model with retro-vynil detail from evanogainen, Here free in Cults3D: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/sonic-blaster-with-gramophonic-generator
- The Sonic blaster, I liked the hedonistic guitar from LoggyK in Cults3D Here: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/hedonistic-sex-fiend-guitar-wip
- For the retro microphone, I choose this free model from DJaviLozano in Cults3D Here: https://cults3d.com/es/modelo-3d/artilugios/microfono-retro
