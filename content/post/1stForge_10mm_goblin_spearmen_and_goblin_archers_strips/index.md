Description :

~~~
This pack contains 12 unique strips of goblins for 10mm wargaming like warmasters or similar games. If your building a Orc & Goblin army this is a cheap alternative to the goblins. Six goblins are on every strip, so you get the feeling of a horde of goblins per stand

Included are 12 strips in total 
2 command strips for spear goblins
3 spear goblin strips
2 command strips for goblin archers 
3 goblin archer strips 
2 mixed spear archer goblin strips

The goblins are around 6 - 6.5mm tall to to there eyes in height.

These are intended for resin printing and should be printed without supports direct on the print bead.


Some detail shown in the pictures will not show on the printed model if not scaled up as most consumer printers cant reach that level of detail.
