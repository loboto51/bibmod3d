Description :

~~~
10mm minotaur berserkers for warmaster revolution (counts-as ogre kingdoms yhetees). Designed to fit 3 per stand.

Yhetees were a difficult unit for me due to their different statline. I eventually settled on charging unarmored berserker minotaurs* to explain:
1) the extra attack 
2) the chase everything rule
3) the 3 hits as opposed to the 4 hits for every other minotaur unit

I think this result conveys point 1 ok-ish, point 2 just fine but point 3 not at all (yhetees have a 5+ save). Still, they should at least be visually distinctive enough for an opponent to tell they're not regular infantry or impalers. Their running pose should hint at their role too. 

All in all I'm moderately satisfied with how they turned out. I am definitely open to suggestions though!


* the amount of freely available minotaur stls is also fairly limited, doubly so when you're going for a "savage" themed look.
