Description :

~~~
Finally I can share with you a little of my slow, but steady progress with the squat miners.

 On this occasion, I made a miner intended to carry the gang's heavy weapons, which in this example is a Heavy Stubber.

I made two versions of the heavy stubber: with double barrels, emulating the weapons of the Ironhead Prostpectors; and the more classic single barrel look, because why not?
The heavy stubber model differs a little from the one you can see in the images, because I didn't really like how it looked printed and I decided to lengthen the barrels.

I also made a special powerpack that does not include tool "holders", because it is exclusive equipment for gang leaders, not ordinary miners.
