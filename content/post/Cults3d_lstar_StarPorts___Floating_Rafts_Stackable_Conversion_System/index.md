Description :

~~~
A humble reworking of the very concept of a raft, optimised for vertical printing.

Floating Rafts are small self-supporting structures that establish platforms parallel with but above the build plate.
This allows you to take models that have been supported for standard printing (or even auto-supported) and quickly convert them into stackable designs with minimal effort!
While individually small, Floating Rafts can be combined side by side to form wider rafts, or even mirrored front-to-back to create much larger rafts suitable for small scale vehicles, or larger scale components like helmets, shoulder pads and weapons for 28mm models.

**Wait, what's the point in stacking prints? Isn't that just a waste of resin?**

Stacking prints incurs a small amount of additional resin use, but brings a number of big advantages:
- You can scale a large number of small print jobs up into bigger print jobs. i.e. You can run one overnight 8h print instead of six or seven 1h30m prints, each of which need to be scraped off the build plate, cleaned, etc, before they can be re-run.
- You can scale small objects to fit in with the largest objects on your build plate. i.e. If you are printing a 28mm vehicle with parts that are 80mm tall, arrange smaller parts in 80mm stacks to make best use of a long print. This allows you to use small amounts of leftover build plate space to print large numbers of components!
- You can _slightly_ decrease overall print times, as stacked components can be kept very close to their floating rafts.


**How do I use this?**

Take any traditionally supported (or even auto-supported!) object that fits within an area you are able to create with Floating Rafts.

1.a. Replace the existing raft with platform made from Floating rafts.
1.b. Optionally shorten the existing supports to 1-2mm. Traditionally objects are raised 5mm above the build plate to avoid raft collision, but that's not necessary when you're up in the stacks!
_(I typically use Blender for this, but you could use subtraction in Windows 3D Builder or a simple Planar Cut in your slicer!)_
2. Stack your objects on central supports.
_(I embed the floating rafts in central support pillars, but for peak resin efficiency, why not try embedding the rafts in something you are planning to print anyway, like the undersides of bases!)_
3. Print!


**Okay, that's great, but where the models at?**

Don't worry, I'll be sharing a number of packs with small-scale (and maybe not so small scale) models I worked on while experimenting with this process, which should give you some useful models to print and ideas for how to use this concept.
