Description :

~~~
WIP ! WATCH THIS THING in case of updates.

This is my version of the 1995 bulkheads that were designed for Necromunda (but re-used in latter boxed sets).
They were designed to work with cardboard pieces to create platforms, catwalks and other industrial terrains.

If you are not familiar with the original, there is a video by Kiblams making the apology of this design: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF_enN4Tz3w]

My version is designed to be printed without support with a PLA printer. It is based on Sirbats' design but with a few adjustments for better printing and new bulkhead feature design.

Without support, the printing is not perfect but tabbletop wortrhy, especially when one is trying to represent a rusty factory underworld.

Hopefully I will make more of these so keep tuned and feel free to give feedbacks !
