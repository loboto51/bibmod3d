Description :

~~~
Like most things I post here, I wanted this model, so I made it, and I hope someone finds it useful too! It's about 50% taller than a normal ork, around 36mm at the head. He needs at least a 32mm base, but 40mm looks better.

This model couldn't have happened without the amazing models from this source:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4532582
 
EDIT: I guess calling this model its proper GW name got it copywrite striked, so I took it down and am reloading it under its proper name.

ALSO, I fixed those hollow skulls!

UPDATE: added a fantasy version too because why not
