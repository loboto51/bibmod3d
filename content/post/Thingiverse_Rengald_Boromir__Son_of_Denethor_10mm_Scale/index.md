Description :

~~~
Boromir, Son of Denethor in 10mm Scale

This model was inspired by the Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring and the pewter model of Boromir produced by Games Workshop. It was produced for the LotR SBG but is in 10mm (epic) scale, not the standard 28mm scale. I know my sculpting isn't great but at that tiny scale, I think he gets the point across.

The White Tree Spearmen are not included in this file. They are from Wake's Emporium.

NOTE: This model has not been test printed.
