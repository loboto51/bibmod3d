Description :

~~~
I was asked to make an all-archer goblin unit, and it instantly took me back to when I first started collecting goblins for Warhammer. Back then, my assistant lecturer’s salary didn’t leave much room for the hobby, so I was over the moon to find an eBay lot of a hundred goblin archers going for pennies. That bargain became my very first goblin archer unit — a proper horde of those classic monopose Kev Adams sculpts, all grinning the same grin, all ready to rain arrows (and probably trip over each other).

This little project was just for the sake of reliving those memories — don’t worry, I’ll be making a proper unit of goblin archers too.
