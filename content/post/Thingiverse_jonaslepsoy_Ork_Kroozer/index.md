Description :

~~~
Ork spaceship that can be used as a Kill Kroozer or a Terror Ship in the long out-of-production game Battlefleet Gothic.

I did the following remix of the source material:
- extracted the Ork Battleship from the source
- scaled it to 100 mm length
- removed the geometry inside the model

Many of the details are obviously too tiny for most printers, so you'll probably need to do some pruning before slicing and printing it at this scale.

Note: I did not design this model. I think it was extracted from Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2.

Updates 2020-05-15:
- I updated the title to "Ork Kroozer", as it is labeled as such in the game.
- I have fixed up the model extensively. I have removed a lot of antennae and small gubbins that wouldn't print properly at the proper scale for the board game.
- I have scaled the model down to about 7 cm, which is the same size as the original metal Kroozers.
- I have added a version with a small base attached. This is meant to be printed in one piece.
- I have added a pre-supported file of the kroozer with small base. Both the STL and Chitubox file is available.
