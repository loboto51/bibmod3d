Description :

~~~
... I do not apologize for the name. Okay, maybe a little bit. But in the grim darkness of certain sci-fi universes, there are only derpy alliterations. 

... and also Mechanic Adepts of all genders, unified in steel and prayer. If you want a model that shows that the last few remaining pieces of flesh in your cybernetic theologians carry two X chromosomes per cell, here you go. 
EDIT: Well, I FINALLY managed to get around to improve this one. First of all, I thickened the legs of the servo-skull and removed the singular pages in the open book. A pity, but it should be easier to print now. On that note, I cut the model into parts, which should make printing and assembly significantly easier.
