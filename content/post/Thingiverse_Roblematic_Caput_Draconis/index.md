Description :

~~~
A Remixed warhound titan head, for jimz warhound.  Made with his original head and this https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3241487

***Make sure to check the scale before printing.****

I wanted to be able to add some options and personality to my titan, I've always liked the amourcast titans of old but didn't feel they'd look right on a ‘modern table’.   So I mixed up a new head.  I hope you like it.

This is probably a first version,  I'm currently working on V2 with more details and added a magnet hole, for swappable heads.  V1 is usable but there's bits I'm going to clean up, particularly where the ears join the head, but that's for the future.  If you don't like it it'll be quick to green stuff.

Any comments are welcome as I rework it.

I decided to include a SLA pre-supported version mostly because I had it, it printed fine for me.  Pre suported is hollowed, but over supported leave some marks v2 coming at some point maybe.
