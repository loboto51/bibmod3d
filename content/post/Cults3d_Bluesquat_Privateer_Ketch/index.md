Description :

~~~
Either built as such, based on a converted escort or an unfinished light cruiser Hull, this type of ship can fill any gap in a merchant (or Smuggler) fleet, from a swift blockade runner to a compact heavy hitter. A lot of commanders uses ketch before being able to obtain much rarer and expensive cruisers hulls. 

**This pack includes :**
- 6 ships ;
- 5 accessories including several turrets.

Models are about 45mm long and can be used as Rogue Trader Lorchas from Warp-rift issue 17. They can also represent civilians and marauders ships or heavy escorts for your Battlefleet Gothic needs or other starship games.

_ The files are unsupported and come with a slot for 3mm or 1/8 inch stem.
_ The bases I like to use are free and can be found here :
