Description :

~~~
Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for an Void Stalker Battleship for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. 

I am not affiliated with GW in any way! Please don't reupload this on Shapeways and the like for commercial use (though you're welcome to upload them to get them printed that way for yourself).

2019-09-22 - Tweaked the upper, lower, and main hulls to make it easier to print and paint. I've left the old ones as they look slightly better. Also fixed the description, as Thingiverse switched the thing and make descriptions.

2019-11-05 - Added a full model for brave printers!
