Description :

~~~
Really enjoyed Tinnuts' Nurgle and Khorne conversion which incorporated chaos god seals on the chaos cruiser ship hulls - so I took ManAtArmsProps god seals and went to town making some additional conversion for each of the Chaos God included in that pack.

Technically, I made these .stl in 3d Builder - Microsoft, so you should be able to load the file and "un-group" Italianmooses' frame and the said seals if you wish to move them around in a different configuration. (If not - please msg me and I'll upload the .m3f file so you can ! )
