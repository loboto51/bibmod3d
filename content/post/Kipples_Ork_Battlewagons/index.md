These are remixes from Vohvel's excellent originals:

I've used some other bits and bobs also, such as JayMull420's glyphs and Alpokemon's quite frankly wonderful chibi tiger:

Update:
See also Cwen's excellent mods of the above base designs over on his Cults page. Nice!

I did these a couple of years ago so I may have forgotten someone's bits: please let me know if so. I'm a bit of a noob with MeshMixer so, again, apologies if for anything messy. I've basically embedded guns in the front, added peg-turrets and given lots of glyph/no glyph [clean] options. They've all printed fine my end so fingers crossed yours. If you have problems with the pegs not fitting the holes properly then just resize the turrets a bit as some resins cure with odd dimensions. These are re-sized to what I think orks should roughly be on the Moonjammy scale (so 90% of Vohvel's originals)? Hope you enjoy using them to munch humies. Waaagh!

UPDATE: 2023-10-11
I didn't expect quite so many downloads so to I've done some extra bits last night that I was going to leave till Christmas. Essentially just some fiddling to create more variety (orks don't really do 'standardised', do they :) ). More glyph options (the numbers correlate with those in JayMull420's pack for those wanting to fiddle more), some new turrets and, crucially, bolted versions of the dozer glyphs in addition to the welded. Hope you enjoy them and any donations to the originators listed above, please, rather than me. Cheers.
