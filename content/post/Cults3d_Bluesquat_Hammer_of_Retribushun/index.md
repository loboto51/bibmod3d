Description :

~~~
Named after the unfortunate cruiser that served to build it's main power core, the Hammer of Retribushun is Captain Hardbak's and his kommandos trusty flagship. Half heavy carrier, half dreadnot, it was on all battles would said Hardbak, loaded with enough heavy fire power, strike bommas and unstable torpedoes to aggressively support greenskins assaults. 

**This pack includes :**
- 1 battleship ;
- separate parts for easier printing ;
- 2x custom weapon modules (heavy guns, launch bays) ;
- the prow has a blank spot to fit a looted weapon.

The ship is roughly 125mm long and can be used to represent the ork battleship Gorbag's Revenge or serve as a base for a large ork capital ship.

_ The files are unsupported and come with a slot for 3mm or 1/8 inch stem.
_ The bases I like to use are free and can be found here :

_This pack is available to anyone so please don't sell, reupload or redistribute the files/models.

**_My ork ships are based on or use free parts from Styxx83's excellent ork fleet, please take a few minutes to browse his work. All the original weapon inserts and other parts can be found on his battleship if needed :**
