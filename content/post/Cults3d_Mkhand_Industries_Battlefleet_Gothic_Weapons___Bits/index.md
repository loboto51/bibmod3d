Description :

~~~
A collection of all the doodads that go in weapon & turret mounts, finally in one place! Everything guaranteed to be usable with all ships, with the exception of Chaos Light Cruiser's Prow mount which will probably look good with only things labelled 'Chaos Mount'

All bits have been touched up and are recommended over the original uploads.  
-Most weapon barrels are bigger, longer, or are more print-friendly. 
-Weapon batteries have bigger detail & the above-mentioned barrel upgrade.
-All launch bays had some details thickened and some embarrassing holes fixed.
-All sensor doodads are thicker, there are also 2 sizes of sensor mast.
-Separated the lance turret from the Start Fort & gave it a centering pin for standard weapon mounts and a mount for the Chaos Light Cruiser prow.
-There are small-size laser batteries now.
-Added a smaller version of the Raiders prow turret.

Any similar bits or doodads will in the future find a home here so this may be updated randomly.
