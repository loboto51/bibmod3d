Description :

~~~
This is a collection of many gothic sci-fi buildings, for 6mm / 1:285 gaming - primarily Battletech and Epic.

The buildings are combinations of tower blocks that equate to level 1, 2 and 3 for when used within Battletech.  There are two types of roof, flat and peeked as well as some other embellishments which means all up there are 290 different buildings in this set, although they're all different combinations of tower blocks.

For Battletech, they are designed to fit entirely within the "standard" Battletech map hexes of 33mm flat edge to flat edge as is used in the current boxed sets. The flat roof versions are also designed to allow Mech models to be placed on them.

The models are designed to be mostly supportless on an FDM printer and have printed fine on my Ender 3.

If you'd like any combination of the towers that isn't currently present, let me know and I'll create it and add it in.

There's a couple of the buildings over on thingiverse if you'd like to try printing them [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4691171](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4691171).

Edit April-2022: Repaired all the stl files and added a second zip file containing the png image files.
