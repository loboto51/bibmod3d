Description :

~~~
**Iota-HU, Pickup Truck**

This file is another remix/remaster of a file made by [TheDude21](https://www.thingiverse.com/thedude21/designs) (check him out and give him a tip, if you like). Much like the previous Glade-S, I very much liked the core Cyberpunk stylings of this vehicle concept and thought that it would make a nice adaption into a 'lower' tech level universe setting as a civilian hovercraft vehicle at the 6mm scale setting.

**About the Design.** Despite the superficial resemblance's to the original design, this project actually took quite a lot of time to remaster, because I wanted to remove as many of the 'hard-angle' edges as possible. This should make the model much better to orientate for supports and 3D print on a resin system. (zoom right in on the file to compare it with the original, if you like!)

**Other Designs.** This model set is intended to be compatible with the other 6mm (true-scale) and Hex(33) (hex scale) SciFi terrain sets that I have released on [Cults 3D](https://cults3d.com/en/users/Shiaic3D/creations) and other locations, [GumRoad](https://shiaic3d.gumroad.com/), [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@Shiaic3D/models) and [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/shiaic1/designs).

Please search my other designs for more models of a similar type and theme.

****************
**Creativity Powered by Patreon.** This model is a remix of free files and parts available elsewhere. However, the time and effort to remix them into a model set like this were enabled with the support of my generous [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Shiaic3D) backers, who gain exclusive access to remixes like this for a temporary period well before it is released wider.

Please check out my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Shiaic3D) if you want to support the creation of more remix projects like this, or gain access to my other remastered works and/or unique terrain creations for 6mm tabletop wargaming.

**Leave a Tip.** Alternatively, please feel free to leave a tip if you like this model and think it is merited (and don't forget to tip any original designers) - an occasional coffee helps fuel the creative effort and sustains morale :)

**Other Files.** Additionally, if you want to find more of my unique 6mm wargame terrain and building creations and other 3D designs, check out my [GumRoad](https://shiaic3d.gumroad.com/) shop or please also see my other unique designs on [Cults 3D](https://cults3d.com/en/users/Shiaic3D/creations). For a small cost (about half a coffee), I have a few re-detailed and remastered 6mm vehicle and FightMech models, such as:
