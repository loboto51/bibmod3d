Description :

~~~
I made these as a resource for myself, as I want to start making up some themed bases, and need the basics in place to build on!

This is an extensive set of round and oval bases, that can be used as spares for existing minis for you to print and texture yourself, or to make life easier when designing your own scenic base STLs. 

The set for magnets are also for those who wish to save a bit of resin - they have support structures underneath the base surface for added strength, with holes for 5mm x 2mm round magnets. This is my preferred magnets for magnetising bases. In case you prefer 1mm thick magnets, I've added a 'filler' that can be printed and inserted into the holes, in case it is any use. Alternatively, just use your preferred modeling putty to fill the hole, and press the magnet into it. 

Included in the set are plain and magnetised versions of the following bases:

Round bases:
25mm
28mm
32mm
40mm
50mm
60mm
65mm
70mm
80mm
90mm
100mm
130mm
160mm
200mm

Oval Bases:
60mm x 36mm
70mm x 25mm bike/cavalry
75mm x 42mm
90mm x 52mm
95mm x 40mm bike/cavalry
105mm x 70mm
120mm x 92mm
150mm x 95mm 
170mm x 109mm



If you use these for making your own base STLs, I'd love to get a nod in the credits!
