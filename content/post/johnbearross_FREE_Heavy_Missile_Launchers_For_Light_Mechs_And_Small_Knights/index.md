Description :

~~~
Unlike most of my catalog of free weapons for Small Knights, their proxies, and equivalents, these titan-thumping missiles have no correlating entry in the rulebooks and codexes.

They're just heavy single-use projectiles meant for blowing big chunks off of enemy targets.

Launch racks are included.  Use them with my Suturus pattern upper arms to fit them to factory kits, or branch off into your own stuff, which is much cooler.

Send pics!

Clean and supported files included.  

Did I mention Free?

Enjoy my other stuff, including Project Raptor frames and weapons.  Raptor frames and hull are shown for illustrative purposes, and are sold separately.
