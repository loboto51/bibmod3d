Description :

~~~
These remixed robos have been broken up for posing! Only the one weapon option - I struggled to get them this far. (full credit to original creator Orange Blue Hue's Tabletop Simulator files)

You have separate pieces for the head, torso and legs. 3D builder is a lovely lil tool so I've added a compatible format for that so you can quickly reposition the parts in there, then save-as stl.

What's changed? RIVETS. SO. MANY. RIVETS. Also I removed the crude skull chest logo, one is blank for customising, the other has a mechanics logo embossed, enjoy!

Four included poses and a builder to do your own. Happy printing!
