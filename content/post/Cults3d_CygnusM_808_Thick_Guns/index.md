I have included pre-supported as well as unsupported files for all models. 

Also I've thrown in some bases made for these models that can be printed in FDM as well as resin.

All filenames end with a "+" followed by a small letter,  this corresponds to the base  that will fit them tiny little feet.

There are five bases in total, "a", "b" and "c" will go with two models each.
"x" and "z" are unique to their specific models
