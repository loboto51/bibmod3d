Description :

~~~
This set contains 7 models in 15/18mm/1:100 scale.* All models are Pre-supported!**

There are 3 troopers equipped with just carbines, 1 with a carbine and power fist (representing an "Honour Claw"), 1 with a Compact Smolder Rifle (could also double as a plasma gun or something in other games), 1 with an Injector Support Weapon (a sort of LMG/SAW), and with with an Injector Support Weapon AND Honour Claw (power fist).

I made these with The Apex faction in mind, but obviously you can use them however you want.

Mystic Space is a newly released game by Nordic Weasel Games/Ivan Sorensen. These figures are released under version 1.00 of the Mystic Space Commercial License. You can get the alpha version of the rules here:
https://www.wargamevault.com/product/521390/Mystic-Space-Alpha-version?src=hottest

*These models are very much "Heroic Scale". They are roughly 17mm to the eyes, and 19mm to the top of the head. This was done to reflect the size of the average Star Born in the Mystic Space lore.

**I test print all my pre-supported files. I tend to go with more supports to be safe. I'd recommend using the hot-water technique to ensure easy support removal.
