Description :

~~~
A radome designed to be 3D printed as terrain for 6mm tabletop gaming. These provide great scatter terrain to add detail to your military bases. It also looks great in an open field as extra cover. The top of the B version is flat and can support a unit placed on top for playability. It is 2 levels tall if you're playing a specific mecha tabletop game.

There are four files. One of each building both with and without hexes so that you can print the one that fits your playstyle. Remember to print the B version if you want the extra support pegs to support units on top for playability. I advise printing these in resin if possible because they are small enough that they don't take much resin, and the details show up smoother.

As always, tipping is appreciated at: paypal.me/rainingfire416

Notable features:
-This building goes perfectly with the other military buildings I've designed.
-Detailed design including entrance door, supported walkway, and radome design.

The model units are in mm and it is scaled such that the hexes are 33mm from flat-to-flat, which is perfect for modern hex maps using 33mm hexes. You can always resize it if your hexes are slightly smaller/larger.

Please post pictures and leave feedback if you make this yourself! I'd love to see prints and use the feedback to adjust overhangs, detail levels, etc. on this model and future ones as well.
