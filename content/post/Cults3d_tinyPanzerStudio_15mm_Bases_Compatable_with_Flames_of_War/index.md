Description :

~~~
1/15/2022 update:
Medium bases are updated. Much love to LEGENDFX for pointing at an issue with them!

Bases in three sizes, Compatible with Flames of War.

Sizes:
Small (32mm x 25mm)
Medium (50mm x 32mm)
Large (65mm x 50mm)

There are a variety of styles:
Smooth
Textured
with holes

These have been designed for a very specific way of printing to avoid warping. The raft is built in and accounted for in the final dimensions.
Layer Height: 0.02mm
6 Bottom Layers

Print them flat on the build plate, then pry off with a razor blade.
