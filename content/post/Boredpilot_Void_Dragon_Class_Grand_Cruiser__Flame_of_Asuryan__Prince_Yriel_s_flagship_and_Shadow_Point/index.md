Description :

~~~
Hi all, we have 3 models in this one for BFG Eldar factions

We have
1, Void Dragon Class Grand Cruiser (No icons so pick your eldar faction)
2,The Flame of Asuryan which is Prince Yriel Flag ship, belonging to craft world Iyanden, so this on has the Logo of the Iyanden craft world
3, Shadow Point which is part of the Ulthwe craft world, as this ship is more expensive then the Flame of Asuryan, Ive made it stand out with it having 5 Sails, (This model i would recommend printing in the 3 pieces and orientate almost vertical for the 2 side pods to reduce the number of supports on the sails, but if you think you can print it as 1 piece feel free to try using the complete version

Ive added a SMOOTH SAIL version of all 3 ships, just look at the name description for SMOOTH SAIL at the end for that version

Ive printed these in resin in a old resin printer (no 4k here and still they came out great)

The wings when printing in resin as it is thin will try warping slightly, once you have cured the wings in light, heat the wings with a hair dry to allow you to bend back into shape, I used my table as the flat surface and held the wing there until it had cooled to be back straight again
