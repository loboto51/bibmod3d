Description :

~~~
I remodeled a lot of parts so that it is easier to print. Additionally, I removed a lot of the spiky parts, and made holes instead. The prow lance, antennas and "wing lances" are all removed, and now have a hole, sized to put a toothpick inside. 

I generally thickened all parts so that it would print nicer, and it is cut for printing. I think this model will give you a really nice result, even if you haven't got a nice printer.

Edit: Made some more simplifications (mainly to the bridge). It should print without any issues now.
