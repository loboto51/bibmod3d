Description :

~~~
These were inspired by a few existing sets of Epic bases:

There are round bases and rectangular bases.  The round ones start from 10mm diameter (which is a bit too small for anything) to up 40mm diameter.  Some of the smaller ones have a single peg/slot hole in them while the 25mm disks have 3 to 5 holes.

I created them in Tinkercad, which is quite handy for this kind of work.

As I need additional types I'll probably add more here.

I wanted rectangular bases for one side, and round bases for space bugs.  Some of the holes are quite close to the edge and you may have problems printing them with larger nozzles - they work fine for me with a 0.25mm nozzle on my Ender 3.
