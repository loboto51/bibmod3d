Description :

~~~
A standard bearer, banner, vexilla and all round show of for every need!

This project has been designed to be as roughly universal as possible. Intended to be used quickly and easily with 3D builder it currently includes 108 variations with plans to add potentially thousands more.

READ ME:
To use, simply select both your preferred mark of armour and your Legion numbered Absolute Standard then open simultaneously with windows 3D builder. They should load pre aligned and ready to be saved as a single figure. 

Or just use the standard you like and add to your own project. Whatever takes your fancy.

Credit goes to:
Moonjammy and his Galactic Crusaders
KillMeForPrizes whose armour builders are always essential
Pass150787 for being very helpful 
and BakaDesigns whom created all the lovely Vectors I have used to make these.

More coming soon hopefully!

If you like and use this project please consider my paid files or dropping me a donation through one of my links. Any contributions allow me to make more free projects for this community!

Always open to suggestions and ideas.
