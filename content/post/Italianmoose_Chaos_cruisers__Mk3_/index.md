Description :

~~~
No printer? No problem! These are now available from Scourge Scenics at https://www.scourgescenics.co.uk/shop/product-category/space-combat/hellfleet

Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for any of the Chaos cruisers and heavy cruisers for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. 

I decided against using the same method for weapons batteries as the originals, it results in a very thin wall on the launch bays that's a job to print! Instead they slot into a cutout in the upper hull, resting on the lower hull.

I am not affiliated with GW in any way! Please don't reupload this on Shapeways and the like for resale (though if you want to get them printed that way for yourself feel free).

2019-04-21 - Added a base hole on the lower hull, and bulked up the prow lance a bit (thanks for the prod, Chios and Grindar!)

2019-12-07 - Added a .zip of the model broken up into smaller bits to be printed bigger.
