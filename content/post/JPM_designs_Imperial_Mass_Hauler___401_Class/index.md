Description :

~~~
The 401 Class Mass Hauler is a heavy logistical vessel designed for the transport of large physical cargoes and containerized freight across interplanetary and interstellar routes. It is a derivative of the Imperial Fuel Hauler – 404 Class, repurposed and modified to carry dense materials, machinery, and raw resources instead of promethium and liquid fuels.

The 401’s massive internal holds and reinforced skeletal frame allow it to carry thousands of tons of bulk freight in standardized cargo containers, making it one of the most efficient load-bearing ships in Imperial service. Unlike its 404-class cousin, which relies on insulated tank systems, the 401 employs open-bay cargo modules supported by magnetic clamps and pressure-sealed loading corridors, enabling rapid reconfiguration depending on mission or contract.

Although primarily civilian in design, many Imperial Navy and Munitorum fleets employ 401 Class Haulers as strategic supply vessels, escorted by destroyers and frigates during wartime operations. In frontier sectors and forge world convoys, these ships are essential lifelines, carrying everything from agri-world grain to Mechanicus machinery between stars.

Like all Imperial industry, their design is rugged, reliable, and ancient, a monument to function over form. They are the arteries of the Imperium, slow but vital, keeping the endless machinery of humanity alive among the stars.

Miniature Specs:
Length: 10.1 cm
Mounting: 3 mm
