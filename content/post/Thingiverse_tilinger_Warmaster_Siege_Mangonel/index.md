Description :

~~~
10mm mangonel for Warmaster. I made a couple of crew strips as well, for all the armies I have designed until now. To my horror I had to discover that I have lost a couple of my master blender files, including all my dwarfs I have not finished yet, so the crew is limited to what I alerady published.

The base model is fantastic in my opinion, I only made some parts more robust for 10mm.

I was already done with the design as I noticed, that the mangonel (and the bombard as well) can indeed turn during a game, but I still left this without wheels, as the illustration in the rules is also fixed.
