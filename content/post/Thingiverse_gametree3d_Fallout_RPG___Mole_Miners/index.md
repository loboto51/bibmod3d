Description :

~~~
A remix of a Garrymod community workshop asset; posed the skeletons in numerous ways, added basic weapons, solidified and thickened them for 3d printing, those kind of treatments. 

You will have to double the size +2cm for Fallout Wasteland Warfare scale (32mm) as these are scaled for 15mm gaming. 

**Note** You could probably take an existing rocket launcher or different shotguns found here on thingiverse and overlay it ontop of the existing double barrelled shotgun if you are technically inclined and want more weapons variety accurate to Fallout 76.
