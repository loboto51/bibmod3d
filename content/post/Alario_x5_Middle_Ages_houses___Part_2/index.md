Description :

"Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the Middle Ages with our collection of 3D printed houses!"

These carefully designed models have been created specifically for 3D printing and are ideal for board games, dioramas and lovers of historical architecture. Each house is tested and ready to print on FDM and SLA printers, ensuring excellent quality and detail at all levels.

All models are made in 28 mm scale, which makes them ideal for most tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder and others.

Features:

Easy to print: The models are designed with the features of 3D printers in mind, minimizing the need for support.
 
Detailing: Authentic medieval architecture, every detail worked out with love.
 
Versatility: Suitable for use both in games and as a decoration.
 
Tested: All models were printed and tested for compatibility with different types of 3D printers.
 
In this project, every small element of the village has been thought out to create an atmosphere of the Middle Ages and the feeling that you are in this era. You will be able to print and assemble each building together, creating a unique composition that will become a worthy decoration of your interior or playing field.

Do not miss the opportunity to purchase this unique project and plunge into the world of medieval architecture and atmosphere!

Victoria is a 3D artist, and Victoria lovingly creates unique models for 3D printing. This project is the result of her passion for the fantasy world and attention to detail.
