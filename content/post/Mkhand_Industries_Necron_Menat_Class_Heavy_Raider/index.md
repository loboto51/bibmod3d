Description :

~~~
As the necrons face increasing resistance they awaken ever more destructive machines. One such new vessel, codified as the Menat class, is a heavy raider in the same basic design as its smaller brethren. The Imperial Navy is yet to have confirmed capabilities for it, but like all necron vessels it carries a threat rating of the highest level.

Made from discarded bits while I was working on the Shroud. Use it an alternative Jackal because there aren't rules for anything like this that I am aware of for BFG. Compatible with GW flight stands.
