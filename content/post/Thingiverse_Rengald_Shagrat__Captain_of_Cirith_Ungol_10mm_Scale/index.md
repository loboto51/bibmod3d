This model was inspired by the Games Workshop minis for the Lord of the Rings the Return of the King. This model were designed to be used with the Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle game but were designed in 10mm (epic) scale not the standard 28mm scale.

There are two versions of this model. The second version is displaying a rude gesture
