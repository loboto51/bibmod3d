Description :

~~~
Hey Hey, Been a while hasn't it. I'm back from a long trip in southern Asia so naturally I come back home and open up blender to see if i still got it.

This is a modification for Tersus's Gorkabot (https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/gorkabot). Send the original creator some love. Their work is incredible and part of the reason I got into 3D modelling in the first place.

What have I done? Basically a conversion into the Morkabot variant. But wait there's more! I've fully supported up the model. Which fits comfortably on to just 3 Saturn 2 build plates.

A lot of you have probably downloaded this model and haven't had the time to support  it, so here you go. I'm fairly decent at supporting but a bit rusty so there may be some mistakes  so make sure to run it through UV tools.

V2 Update 
-Magnetized all arm and weapon connection points.
-Added tons of new arm/weapon/Bitz styles
-Fixed a few meshes errors
-Made an attempt to allow the doors to open and pivot.
-Combined  meshes to optimize printing in resin.
