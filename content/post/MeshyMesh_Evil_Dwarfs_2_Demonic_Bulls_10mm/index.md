Description :

~~~
The Evil Dwarfs are friends with angry folk. The demonic bulls give you two different options. A red winged bull and a larger angrier bull that has wings aflame. 

These files come supported and unsupported.

Both red and flame bull are INCLUDED in this download.

They both also come with two different flight stands (varying height) and stls versions that have holes to fit the flight stands in. The holes have been made to allow the flight stands to either go in directly or on an angle.

Note the wings are in one pose, however my recommendation is that you bend and tape (use clear tape) to the desired angle before curing. Use some hot water to further soften the wings for bending. Then dry and apply the tape. With the tape secured you an cure the model and the wings will stay at their taped shape :)

The rock base has been designed for the flaming bull. There are two versions, one with impressions to stick the bull on and one to allow you to stick him anywhere. It also includes sizes for 40x20mm bases and 25mm round bases.

Enjoy!
