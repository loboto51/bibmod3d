Description :

~~~
Mixing the darkest of magics with the fires of the Bull God, the Fire Elemental Demons are born for destruction and little else!

When fully assembled these Fire Elemental Demons stand about 60mm tall. They are designed to go on 40mm bases.
This is a multipart kit for an incredible amount of variety to your units. It contains:
- 4 torsos
- 6 heads plus a unit champion (has a big hat/crown and chain beard)
- 2 upper bodies, these can be mirrored
- 3 lower bodies, these can be mirrored
- 6 weapons, these can be mirrored and used for either hand

Files come pre-supported and unsupported. 

Happy printing!

ASSEMBLY
- Good to print a variety of parts, most things should dry fit to a point so you can get the poses just right.
- I recommend glueing together one Fire Demon at a time. This way you can plan the next Fire Demon so they rank up nicely (I did my best however to give the right balance between pose and variety).

Pictures of models are test prints.
