Description :

~~~
A mixed use building designed to be 3D printed as terrain for 6mm tabletop gaming. The top of the building is large and flat enough to support a unit placed on top for all 7 hex locations. It is 2 levels tall if you're playing a specific mecha tabletop game.

There are two files. One has the building on hexes and the other is hexless so that you can print the one that fits your playstyle. Further, there is a second variation of this building, uploaded as “Mixed Use Building 2B” here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4598435

The difference between the two buildings is that 2B has simplified windows and slightly different placement of the windows around the building. This provides you with different versions of the same building that you can use to vary the look of your terrain.

Notable features:
-Detailed design including doors, windows, and a detailed roof area with greebles such as ducting.
-This building is designed as a mixed use building, meaning that the ground floor could be commercial retail space while the upper floors are used as apartments. Of course, you can use the building as whatever you'd like, and you could even use it as a manufacturing facility, storage facility, or something else if you're creative.

The model units are in mm and it is scaled such that the hexes are 33mm from flat-to-flat, which is perfect for modern hex maps using 33mm hexes. You can always resize it if your hexes are slightly smaller/larger.

Please post pictures and leave feedback if you make this yourself! I'd love to see prints and use the feedback to adjust overhangs, detail levels, etc. on this model and future ones as well.
