Description :

~~~
The Epsilon Pattern helmet is a 3D printable helmet designed for Space Dwarfs that like to hunt during the night. these types put fear into their enemies who know they're out there, they just don't know where. 
There is now an Exaggerated Scale model that scales up smaller details for easier printing and painting (in files as "_ExScale"). this version is still developing so it may change a few times. make sure you give any feedback if you think any changes are necessary or cool.
I have added a fixed pose for warrior units, however I haven't been able to test it's fit as I don't have any unglued warriors if you end up downloading please let me know if I need to make changes
