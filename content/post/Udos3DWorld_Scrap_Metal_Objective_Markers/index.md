Description :

~~~
We have so much scrap metal terrain, so we also need some suitable objective markers to make everything fit together!

These markers allow you to place a custom banner in them (I usually have a set of banners/flags per army and to show which side controls the objective, you can just put YOUR flag in there). You can either create a banner yourself (suggested rod diameter is 2.2mm), or you could use my free online banner generator ( https://udos3dworld.com/BannerGenerator/ ), or the one from my generator suite ( https://udos3dworld.com/generator.html ). And of course these objective markers are fully compatible to any others.

Doing so many designs for free is a lot of work. If you want to support me and my goal to provide free models for everyone, I'd be happy if you would become a patron - which allows me to work on even more stuff: https://www.patreon.com/c/Udos3DWorld
