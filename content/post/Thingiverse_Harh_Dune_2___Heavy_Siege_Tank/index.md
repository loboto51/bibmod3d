Description :

~~~
Onece I thought: can I make a model using so simple reference as a few pixel graphics images? I've liked the game Dune 2 - The Building of a Dynasty made by Westwood Studios in it's time and always liked it's mentat/building menu units' images. I think they were a very good designed things. So I thought it would be a nice challenge to complete :)

It took a lot of time to make a model actually, since I didn't attend to it too much. I didn't like the way how the front and the back of the tank's body looked like, but overally the model looks nice anyway. I also thought maybe to make textures for the model and finally remake an original Dune 2 "slide", but got a bit lazy to do so.

But the case I was lazy was that I wanted actually to print this model and paint it. I don't have much experience in painting tanks, since I'm too far away from stand modeling, but, anyway, I just wanted to make a good try. You can see the actual photos of the result and decide it for yourself.

By the way, I've tried to find a lead Dune 2 designer - Aaron E Powell - to show the tank. It ought to be an interesting salute after 20 years, but, alas, didn't manage to find him - found three of his sites with (C)2014 stated there and with no reply for theese sites' local message system.

Hope people who still remember that nice old game will like the fact it is now possible to look it in real 3D and even being able to print it :)

Also there is an article (though in Russian) how I've made this tank. It includes more WIP images, just in case someone would be interested:
