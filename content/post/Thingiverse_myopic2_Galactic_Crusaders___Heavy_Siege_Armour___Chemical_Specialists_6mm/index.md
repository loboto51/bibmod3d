Description :

~~~
Some tiny dudes with grenade launchers from the legion with poor personal hygiene, ready for you to commit tiny war crimes. A basic edit of MoonJam's excellent Heavy Siege Armour guys. Only three poses, but you could sub in the sarge or heavy weapons guys from the original thing if that bothers you.

Intended for resin printers. Contrary to advice on the original models I use 0.05 layer height and 8xAA and can't tell the difference from tabletop distance (I've tried both settings, original was 0.02 & 2xAA).

Should print right out of the box without any additional supports, but spending five minutes running them through Photon File Validator is recommended. I'm just getting started 3d modelling for printing, so if you have issues please let me know.
