Description :

~~~
The blasphemous civil war has spread across the galaxy, and some of the GMO super soldiers have decided to make armor held together by lots of big round studs...

Included are 2 different "stances", with options for a full helm with crest, or half-helm, and every combination of regular pistol, plasma pistol, chain sword, power sword, and power fist.

These have been slightly altered, reproportioned, and assembled from various free files. As-is they are slightly taller (and a lot bulkier) than a normal 15mm model. They are approximately the same size and proportions as a Galactic Crusader scaled to 225%. If you want them "true scale" you should upscale them to about 110%.
