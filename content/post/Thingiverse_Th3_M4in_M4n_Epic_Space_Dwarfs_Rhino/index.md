Description :

~~~
+++ The "Knarr" pattern is a variant of the Rhino APC specially designed by and for squats. All its internal layout, instruments and technical characteristics have been modified and adapted for the needs (and size) of the squats, so that the vehicle is uncomfortable and even impossible to use by other abhumans, normal humans and much less by Astartes, but for squats it is such a comfortable, spacious and versatile vehicle that many agree that they could live in them if it were possible. And some actually do.+++

This is a Epic size Rhino APC designed for the Grindel Sronghold army list that you can find here: https://tacticalwargames.net/taccmd/viewtopic.php?f=134&t=33281&sid=422418b4bea515739e1aef8d862588e5

I included 3 variants: The Rhino without accesories; with a classic "ram"; and with a dozer blade. Also i included the ram and the dozer as separated models so you can test if you like the printed model with or without them.
