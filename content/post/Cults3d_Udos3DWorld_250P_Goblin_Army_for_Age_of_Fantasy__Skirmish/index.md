Description :

~~~
I wanted to try something... so I decided to go for a fully AI generated Goblin Army. And as you see, it worked! It wasn't that easy, AI still producing shitty meshes, a lot of rework to do, so you still do need some 3D modeling skills to do something like this, but we're receiving a result! Still some of the models don't look that good, some stuff was bent, distorted, or just wrong, but I tried to fix as much as possible. Let me know what you think! Is AI dangerous? Or is it just a tool that makes it easier for us to be creative?
