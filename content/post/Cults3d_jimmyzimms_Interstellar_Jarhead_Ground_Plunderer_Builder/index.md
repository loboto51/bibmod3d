Description :

~~~
Provides a version of Woddish's excellent Tiny Bigger Tank Fancy APC and Tiny Bigger Awkward Tank and related things that have been sliced into major parts that are enabled to be quickly swapped and edited for customization by changing visibility of components between different options for support turrets, sponsons weapons, hatches, symbols, and track armour to make Land Raider based vehicles (Phobos, Crusader, Redeemer, Helios, and Prometheus variants currently).

This is intended for designers and modelers to product their own faction customized vehicles from in a standardized and high quality form.

New part contributions are welcome!

Parts included from Woddish, Orcstain, Wolfkeeper, and Gentleben

Edit 20220501: I've found issues on certain components having flipped normals (teach me to do this while attending a conference!). In addition based on feedback I've adjusted many of the door symbols in size and scales. I've produced a written guide as a basic primer for that are not familiar with Blender and/or 3D modeling trying to use this tool as well.

Edit 20220526: Added additional armoured plates options to the design

Edit 20230620: Corrected a couple of non-manifold faces and added the alternate Multimelta sponsons built for the Land Raider Achilles model to the builder.

Edit 20231023: Added 2 different Rainbow Warriors chapter symbols to the builder.

Edit 20231229: Added Raptors Legion symbols to the builder

Edit 20240515: Normalized all the iconography between all the builders to have the same sets.

If you like what I did and want to leave a tip it would be appreciated.
