Description :

~~~
AdMech fleet elements for Microfleet Gothic. All ships are scaled at roughly 50% of original size, and have an integrated receptor for a 5x1mm magnet on the underside of the hull.

Ships in this set designed by Italianmoose. Say thanks by giving him a tip!

This is a work in progress; the fleet needs a couple more battleships, and maybe some escort variants.

EDIT 18 June 2020: added another Ark Mechanicus, along with the 'official' variant from the 2010 Compendium (replaces the lance bays with fighters). Based on Italianmoose's work.

Bases, templates, and guidelines for playing Microfleet Gothic can be found here:
