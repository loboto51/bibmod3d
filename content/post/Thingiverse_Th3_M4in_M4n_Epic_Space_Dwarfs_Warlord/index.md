Description :

~~~
+++ Warlord is the title of Squat commanders. Warlords are close relatives of Stronghold Lords, and take command of a Stronghold's Brotherhood in battle. On the battlefield he is accompanied by a unit of elite warriors knows as Hearthguard, each one  drawn from the Lord's loyal retainers, who formed an aristocratic class in Squat Strongholds. +++


This is a Squat Warlord unit designed for NetEpic Armageddon, in specific for the Grindel Sronghold army list that you can find here: https://tacticalwargames.net/taccmd/viewtopic.php?f=134&t=33281&sid=422418b4bea515739e1aef8d862588e5

The list does not consider the classic Squats exosuits, which gave me some creative freedom and I decided that both the warlord and his hearthguard would be equipped with power armor, for which I used (again) the fantastic models designed by Toftylicious. This also opens the possibility of creating an Epic scale army of squat marines in the distant (grimdark) future.

I have designed two warlord models, one with a thunder hammer and one with a power axe; two hearthguard models, although the difference is almost imperceptible; and a banner-bearing hearthguard. 

About the very small supports, i placed each one by hand so probably many are redundant or totally unnecesary for the model size, but overall they gave good results on printing.
