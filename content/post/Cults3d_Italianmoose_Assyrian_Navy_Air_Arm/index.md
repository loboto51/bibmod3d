Description :

~~~
Assyrian navy attack craft for your games of Battlefleet Gothic. These are a bit larger than the original models so they can print better and have more detail. I've gone for rough hints of atmospheric capability, though with those noses they'll arrive with quite a bang. Also comes with a printable 25 mm square base. For assault boats, I'm going to shamelessly recommend stealing the resource collectors from: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2994894

I am not affiliated with GW in any way! Please don't reupload this on Shapeways and the like for commercial use (though you're welcome to upload them to get them printed that way for yourself).

2021-07-25 - Realised I messed up the base sizes! Replaced the base with the correct size (20 mm)
