Description :

~~~
IT'S THE LATE 80's, IN SPAAAAACE!

Everyone has mohawks and piercings! 
Industrial Metal head anarchists galore!

Here are a few heavy weapons options for your human sized dudes and dudettes, Inspired by classic Necromunda. I give you low tech solutions to deadly problems.

The BRRT Supression Stubber:
All style and zero substance with this over designed chunk of metal, it'll throw roughly bullet shaped things in a roughly straight line. You'll need steroids top deal with kick up though.

Australian Stubber:
The bullets go in ..... UPSIDE DOWN!?
That's right, make gravity your accomplice when you mow down a MF with this retro gravity fed SOB.

Firehazard:
Loaded with homemade fuel that you can dink in a pinch to get your liver upset, the fire hazard is dangerous to everyone, that's cool right? OSHA are nerds!

BAGL (The Ga-chunk):
The Bow Assisted Grenade Launcher or the BAGL (sometimes called the Ga-chunk!) on account of the sound it makes.
Who says you need fancy gas assisted launching mechanisms? Who had the bright idea to try and launch explosives with smaller explosions? 
That guy is dead, because those Ideas are hard to execute.

Why go complicated when you can just update a medieval stonebow with modern polymers and alloys.

Possibly the only "stealth" grenade launcher on the market!

Resin would be Ideal, but I've printed the smaller assault rifles I made on FDM and they barely look any more trash than other necromunda weapons! (0.2 nozzle is necessary)
