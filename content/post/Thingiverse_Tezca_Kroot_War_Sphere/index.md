Description :

~~~
EDIT: increased diametre of the pegs that connect the rings to one another and the cap piece, and the size of the guide pegs from the innersphere connector to the ring 2 cross beams. tl:dr made it better

No idea how this prints in a single piece, or the supports involved, as it's really meant to be printed in pieces.

The rings and cap are meant to be put together with a bit of luck and a keen eye, I provided no guides. ring 1 (big one) on the inside, ring 2 next, then cap. Don't overthink where they attach. 

Once those are assembled, the inner ball attaches to the Ring_2 cross-support piece, with guide pegs to line up a better fit found on the end of the innerball connector arms.

Print doubles of the rings and cap, of course.
