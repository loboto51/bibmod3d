Description :

~~~
Demon character for warmaster both with and without supports using Schlossbauer's awesome twigblight. I initially wanted to use this as a greater demon, but seeing the size of the forest dragon treeman I needed another model to fill that role. I'm going to use this one as my general instead. Yes, it's obviously a tree thing, but just imagine what it looks like if you paint the torso bone-y and the arms/legs bloody (or find my post on the warmaster revolution facebook to see my actual paint job).

10mm demon army
See my collections for the other units; I have a unit for each of the roles in warmaster revolution and a couple of heroes. Note that this army does not inherently match one of the big four chaos gods by design, as I find them dreadfully boring.

Supports
The supports are auto generated by Prusa. Nothing much to it.

Why?
I just got a 3d printer and was looking to get into warmaster with some friends when I noticed that there is no ready to print demon army yet. Given my 0-level modelling skills I instead decided to use existing models to create the army; this unit is one of the outcomes of this project.

Disclaimer
To be sure: none of these models are actually mine. I am a complete hack blundering his way through blender; all I can do is resize models, fatten segments and add cylinders (you may spot some of my handiwork on other models, or here!).
