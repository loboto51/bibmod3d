Description :

It is clearly a crime that the Greatest Model Of All Time seems not to be available in a teeny form so hopefully this goes some way to fixing that.

This is a reworking of Miffles (now sadly) 'missing' (🙄) dreadnought; I've included those files in the 'miffles original' folder. I started this years ago and only dug it out again recently. Alas, my CAD skills are very much in the noob-zone (hence the name of the model) so apologies for both the woeful nature of some of the hack-n-slashing and also the resulting files sizes. I'm revving up a campaign of nagging any of those Legends of our hobby (Woddish, Jimmyzimms, KMFP, Daffmakes, Mildseven etc) to actually do it properly. Fingers crossed :).

This is the Grim version, over which I have plastered a load of bolts and various other gubbins. I've included a load of body versions, with different torso angles and feet orientations: I'm sure you'll work it all out from the file names. I've also included looser-fitting mount options in case your resin tolerance can't take the snugger version. The identifier 'small' for the legs is in juxtaposition to a 'large' version I trialled  (about 110% enbiggening of legs). I like the Deadpool-2-re-growing look of the originals but if any of you want something that looks a bit less top-heavy then let me know and I might finish the re-work.

I've done 'TrueScale' (top of head, not to eye) 8mm versions and also 10mm for easier re-scaling (so, for example, if you game in 18mm just print at 180%).

I may also do another upload with some non-bolty Tech monopose versions, with the larger legs, for a more hard-scif vibe. 

Cheers

Kipples

PS: The '0-mount' identifier in the file names means I haven't put any mount rings on the body. I've tried this for the Tech version, though, which has a single ring spacer for the mounts so they're less flush with the torso.
