Description :

~~~
A motley gang of fungal aliens, equipped with a variety of different weapons. My design document (ideas behind these guys) that I wrote for Orktober 2024 is included in the original release (link below).

I finally expanded on the original 2, which you can get here: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/fungal-aliens

Number 01 has been slightly tweaked had some non-manifold geometry fixed. A pre-supported version of 02 is also included (which wasn't in the original).

They are 15mm scale by default. Pre-supported versions in 15mm are included! I'm experimenting with FDM friendly pre-supported versions, but those aren't done yet.

If you want to scale them up to 28-32mm scale, I'd suggest somewhere between 165-170%.
