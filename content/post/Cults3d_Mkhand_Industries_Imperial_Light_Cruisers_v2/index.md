Description :

~~~
The Imperial Navy's light cruisers come in almost as many classes as the bigger cruisers. Some are used as long range patrol craft or convoy flagships while others are heavy escorts that accompany the largest capitol ships into the thickest fighting.

The prow comes from the same steam workshop page I obtained the Imperial Cruiser from. Everything else made from scratch. See Imperial Cruisers for weapon turrets. Good for Battlefleet Gothic, as a stand-in for Lunar Class Cruisers in Epic:Armageddon and bringing the Emperor's Light to other heretical space games.

25/12/2017: Added detail to the prow and engines. Made the back walls of the weapons bays thicker. Added a new bridge, command deck, and weapons bay type that uses the weapon options of standard Imperial Cruisers. Included assembled 'Endeavour' class out of all changed/new parts to illustrate them. 

28/12/2017: Changed the hole for mounting on flight stands to 3mm.

2022-12-27: Fixed "Bridge Bottom A" missing the guide-slots for the wings
