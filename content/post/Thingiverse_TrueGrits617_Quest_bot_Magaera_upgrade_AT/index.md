Description :

~~~
AT knight Magaera upgrade kit.
note: The scale is in the ball park and might not be exact will take a few prints to nail it down. Also some minor modding to the plastic kit will be need to get get the groin armor on your knights. 
update thanks to a friend I was able to refine the armor a bit as it was too big to fit on the plastic knight kits with some trial and error I am nailing down the scale to make this kit usable for all.
The new armor now allows for head posing and secondary weapon posing as well as the styrix grav secondary has been added. 
Next the siege claw will get some slight tweaking in size and has some added pose options for it. 
the real armor 2.1 is uploaded the fist one had a issue and was displaying a second 2.3 should be correct now.
