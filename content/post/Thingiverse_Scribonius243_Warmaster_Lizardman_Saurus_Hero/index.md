Description :

~~~
A 10mm Lizardman Saurus hero for Warmaster, both supported and unsupported.

This has been designed for resin printing, and the supported version should print as is. I have test printed the supported version but with failures (using the bellow settings), most likely due to issues with my printer and not the file.

Thank you to LennyFace for the base model, and UncleKam for the base.
