Description :

~~~
All ships in my Tartarus Fleet to make up a whole fleet of ships that would make a good chaotic gothic style fleet.

There are 9 different ship types

7 classes can be built to your style by swapping out broadsides or turrets.

---------------------------------------------------

- Revenant Class battleship
-------

2 x Prow option
1 x Top
1 x Mid section
1 x lower hull

(about 55ml of resin with supports)

---------------------------------------

- Banshee Class Grand Cruiser.
------

2 x Top Option
2 x Hull Option
- 1 hull section has space for imperial broadsides. I have others on my profile as a free download. 3rd party ones will also fit.
1 x Topper for the tower at the back. A turret or other extra bits will fit there also.

---------------------------------------

 - Strigoi Class Heavy Cruiser.
------

3 x Top Hull Types
2 x Bridges

--------------------------------------

- POSSESSED SHIP- STRIGOI CRUISER

2 x Hull Types
2 x Bridges

------------------------------------

- Lamia Class Light Cruiser.
-------

1 x Top option
3 x Lower Hull options

-------------------------------------

To Build the ships you get:
1 x Launch bay module. (mirror for the other side)
1 x weapon bay module
1 x Single Turret with weapons module - 3 x turrets to fit
3 x smaller turret option. These will fit the bare slots better.
1x Skull Turret
1 x Cargo Module

Extra bits that apart from the forward bridge will fit into the slots :
1 x Forward Bridge
2 x Mast
1 x Radome

---------------------------------------

 - Umkhovu Class Escort.
------

There are 5 bridge options
- Skull Flat

- Tall Bridge
- Dome Brigde
- Cannon in place of a bridge.

- Dybbuk Class Escort.
-----
- With turret slot at the front.

- Svarog Class Escort.
------

The engine bay for the escorts will need to be printed seperatly and stuck in place afterwards. T2_Rear

=================
READY WITH A HOLE FOR A 2MM FLIGHT STAND THAT IS FAIRLY STANDARD. CAN INSTEAD BE FITTED WITH A 4MM MAGNET IF YOU MAGNETISE YOUR STANDS.
(I do have a free stand download but there are loads to pick from) The clear ones in the photo are for display only. The ones with a brass rod are a free download on my profile

For personal use, Not for resale as a digital file or printed copies
========================
Designer notes:

The Heavy cruiser is slightly larger and broader than the Krekavac Cruiser. The bridges will fit but might look a bit lost on the heavy hull.

You may want to paint before sticking together. The internal hangars can be seen inside after assembly.

The Battleship, Grand & Heavy cruiser comes with an optional cargo module to fit on the lower hull. It bulks the hull out and ships in space need extra cargo! It will accept other broadsides but it might look odd with a weapons one there due to the angle. The cargo module will also fit in the regular broadside slots if you want to make a cargo cruiser.  I do have 2 other cargo styles that are sold separately
