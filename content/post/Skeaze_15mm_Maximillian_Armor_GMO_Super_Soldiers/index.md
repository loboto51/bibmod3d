Description :

~~~
5 "tactical" poses of GMO super-soldiers wearing 4th generation armor.

Versions with and without a small molded base are included (i like to have them because I mount mine on metal washers and the based covers the hole).

Free parts have been meticulously pulled apart, resized, reproportioned, altered, or remodeled myself. Then reassembled and posed. They have been made to match the proportions of the famous 8mm "Galactic Crusaders", but with much more detail.

Credits:
- pretty sure all the parts in these ones are just from Loggyk.
