Description :

~~~
Imperial cruisers designed for planetary operations are popularly termed Strike Cruisers. Several classes exist; all are fast, exceptionally well armoured and heavily armed with a mix of specialised barrage bombs, bombardment cannons and assault craft. Their high cost means they are operated almost exclusively by Imperial Space Marines.

Almost all parts are compatible with the files from Imperial Light Cruisers.Takes the weapons and turret options from Imperial Cruisers. Comes with a hole to accept standard flying stands. Scaled to overall length, had to eye-ball everything else.

Excellent for games of Battlefleet Gothic or other, lesser, space games, as well as representing orbital assets in Epic: 40 000.

28/12/2017: Changed the hole for mounting on flight stands to 3mm. Redid Wing B, added Bridge Bottom.

31/12/2017: Flattened prow B down and made it wider.
