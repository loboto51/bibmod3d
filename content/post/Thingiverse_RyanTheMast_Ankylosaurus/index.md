As always I will promote and REWARD the first people to post quality makes (must enable tips on your profile for reward). A quality make is a successful, complete, hopefully decent looking print at 50% scale or larger. This doesn't necessarily need painted but extra bonus if it is.

Update!: https://www.thingiverse.com/Justin87/about was the winner of -some- of this things "First Make Award" check out their page! Remember prizes go to the first few to show their makes so please post, like, and follow.

If this proves popular, I will work on some other Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Creatures,as well as accessories and variants of this model if requested. I could possibly do things like battle wounds, dino-rider armor, a wall mountable bust, a jungle base. So Please post your makes, hit like, and provide feedback on what you would like to see in the comments.

Ankylosaurus  (meaning “fused lizard”) is a genus of thyreophoran dinosaur. Fossils of Ankylosaurus have been found in geologic formations dating to the very end of the Cretaceous Period, between about 68–66 million years ago, in western North America, making it among the last of the non-avian dinosaurs. It was named by Barnum Brown in 1908, and the only species classified in the genus is A. magniventris. A handful of specimens have been excavated to date, but a complete skeleton has not been discovered. Though other members of Ankylosauria are represented by more extensive fossil material, Ankylosaurus is often considered the archetypal member of its group.

The front part of the jaws were covered in a beak, with rows of small, leaf-shaped teeth further behind it. It was covered in armor plates, or osteoderms, with bony half-rings covering the neck, and had a large club on the end of its tail. Bones in the skull and other parts of the body were fused, increasing their strength, and this feature is the source of the genus name.

Compared with modern land animals the adult Ankylosaurus was very large. Some scientists have estimated a length of 11 meters (36 ft).[1] Another reconstruction suggests a much smaller size, at 6.25 m (20.5 ft) long, up to 1.5 m (5 ft) wide and about 1.7 m (5.5 ft) high at the hip.[2] Ankylosaurus may have weighed over 6,000 kilograms (13,000 lb), making it one of the heaviest armored dinosaurs yet discovered. The body shape was low-slung and quite wide. It was quadrupedal, with the hind limbs longer than the forelimbs. Although its feet are still unknown, comparisons with other ankylosaurids suggest Ankylosaurus probably had five toes on each foot. The skull was low and triangular in shape, wider than it was long. The largest known skull measures 64.5 centimeters (25 in) long and 74.5 cm (29 in) wide.[4] Their teeth were weaker than ceratopsid and hadrosaurid dinosaurs of the time, so they probably chewed very little.
