Description :

~~~
A Thunderhawk Ordinance proxy for Battlefleet Gothic.

A game buddy asked for some prints and I couldn't find a suitable model.

As per 2nd pic...
- The scale is based on the Imperial Attack Craft Models by Mkhand_Industries
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2626812
- The shape is heavily borrowed from a similar model on $h@p#w@y$.

While i very much like Mkhand's models (and have printed a number for my Imperial fleet) i've found that the wings are very delicate on my filament printer... as such the thunderhawk wings are all a little chunkier (minimum 0.5mm).

Has now been netfabb'd.

Have test printed. works but it's like tiny tiny (as per last pic).
Re pic: the small ones are what the file produces. the big one is 250% scale just to test that stuff was there and printing.
Re other pic: (not finished) paint just to add some colour.
The teeny-tiny ones do look ok once they're on stands. And there's a fair amount of tricky support cleanup. enjoy.

Note: For my marine fleet i've printed these at 133%. just to get a bit more 'detail' and less blobbular. these are the yellowish ones. note that for sticking them to the bases i just use some chopped filament, was easier than printing the bases with stands as they were coming out horrible.
