Description :

~~~
15mm scale elite sci-fi troopers in fully sealed armored suits carrying special weapons.

This pack contains 9 total models, 3 poses each of Flamethrowers, Grenade Launchers, and Plasma Guns (but they could also be used as melters, or other sci-fi energy weapons).

There are both unsupported, and pre-supported* versions of each, including Lychee files.

*I'm not a professional at this, but I've test printed them and they all came out good for me. I tend to go heavier on the amount of supports, but if you use the "hot water method" they should come off easily.

The design is loosely inspired by "auxiliary" troops that would fight in the era of galactic conquest and civil war 30,000 years in the future...
However, I wanted to make them look more strange and ancient, like they are from a semi-mythologized event that took place 10,000 years in the past. These should also work well in other sci-fi, or even steampunk, weird-war, or post apocalyptic settings.
