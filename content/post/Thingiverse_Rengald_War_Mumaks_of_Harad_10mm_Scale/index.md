Description :

~~~
War Mumaks of Harad or Oliphaunts in 10mm Scale

This model was inspired by the Mumak kit released by Games Workshop. Reference photos were used but this is an original work. These are two poses of the same model. The models was designed to be used with the Lord of the Rings Battle Strategy Game but this model is in 10mm scale, not the typical 28mm scale. Crew is not included.

Note: The second model has some mesh tearing that I could not figure out how to fix but it printed fine.
