Description :

~~~
This model is a Proxy for the MK1 Mars Pattern Predator (AKA Rogue Trader Style).

Based on my Epic MK1 Mars Pattern Rhino Proxy
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2823744

The "FULL" model is for display purposes only.  It will likely be ugly as sin if you try to print it.

Print at 100% for regular 6mm Epic scale
Print at 105% for "Truescale" 6mm
Print at 110% for 8mm New AT 2018 Scale

CHANGELOG
2018-03-15 - Added a Post for Turret alignment. Flagging as Complete.  
2018-03-13 - After a successful overnight print run, I discovered a couple of holes in the Mesh and more misalignments due to workflow issues.  Updated Files have been uploaded.
2018-03-12 - I have not printed, therefore have not tuned this model. I do not expect any issues with the portions shared with the Rhino.
NOTE: If you downloaded this thing prior to 9PM EST I have found a bug in the model caused by me running it through MS 3D Builder. This bug caused a few mis-alignments between the parts that make up the various meshes. Please accept my apologies I will be posting new files Shortly.

This is based on my first project in Fusion 360 and was started in SketchUp 2018. Enjoy!
