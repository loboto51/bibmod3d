Description :

~~~
The Elven Caestopaeifs served their world well, giving many weapons painstakingly designed. However, most of the schools of such crafters hide dark secrets.Being obedient to wise gravekeeping seers, they prepare carcasses for rituals comparable with grave-robbery. The spirits of the fallen warriors occupy cold animated statues of tough eldritch material to fight against alien occupants, so the living Elves could hear songs of joy ever again. Monsoon Warhost of Beal-Tanny remember the desperate action to revive dead exile brethren from their defiled Kurghans on paradise world of Taran, so they could avenge on aliens as mighty undead gargantuans in the war.

The Smallwraith models are made using model builder by Karadryel (https://cults3d.com/en/users/Karadryel/3d-models)
The Ligma Razor model is a free model by Spear Miniatures
(https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/d-reaper-gun-only)

UPDATE:
2023 August 15th - separate legs for CQC Smallwraith models added, now the models have new Phantom Swords and Spook Bardiche objects appropriate for printing in 8mm scale.

NOTICE:
- the models are not tested yet, there’re no supported stls required for safe printing, so the prints are required for experienced hobbyists;
- model sturdiness, especially Phantom Swords variants, is questionable;
- the preview images are dated.

THANKS TO:
Mannschaft for Smallwraith models test printing and reporting for flaws found;
MKhand_Industries for supporting and suggesting ideas (https://cults3d.com/en/users/Mkhand_Industries/creations)
