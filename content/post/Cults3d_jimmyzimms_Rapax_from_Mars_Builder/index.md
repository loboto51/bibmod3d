Description :

~~~
Provides a version of Woddish's excellent Tiny Tank Fancy MBT and related things that have been sliced into major parts that are enabled to be quickly swapped and edited for customization by changing visibility of components between different options for turrets and weapons to make Predator based vehicles (Destructor, Annihilator, Baal, and Infernus) in both armoured and standard versions.

This is intended for designers and modelers to product their own faction customized vehicles from in a standardized and high quality form.

New part contributions are welcome!
