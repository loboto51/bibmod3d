Description :

~~~
A pre-Fall Elfdar luxury cruiser. What I imagine the Elfdar would have used when they just wanted to enjoy the feeling of sailing - the Sunjammer. About as pretty and as detailed as I can manage.

So, why something off-the-wall like this? My mother has been fighting cancer for the past few years and it has now become inoperable. When she was younger she used to sail in little boats called Lasers, which were tiny, fragile, fast things. Her boat was called Tiny Dancer (like the Elton John song). Hence when I decided I'd do something to remember her by, I decided on a very fast Eldar ship.

Could I ask as many of you as possible to print one out, so that all over the world there would be some memory of her? Can I also ask that no-one sticks a gun on this, it would just feel wrong.

If you would like to donate, she's said she'd wants to support Macmillan, who have been really lovely helping her out:

The usual shtick, I am not affiliated with GW in any way! I know it's a bit cheeky to do this but it means a lot to me. Please don't reupload this on Shapeways and the like for commercial use (though you're welcome to upload them to get them printed that way for yourself).
