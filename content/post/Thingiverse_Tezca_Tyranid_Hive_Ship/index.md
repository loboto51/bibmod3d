Description :

~~~
A Hiveship. I hope you like it, it's different from many out there. I am trying to skip the "extra tyranid claws glued together" look.

The fins are coded front to back by the number of knocks in them, 4 being the front, 3 mid, and 2 rear. They don;t have ball joints, but rather flat surfaces to glue, so feel free to model around that design limitation.

NOTE: This guy is very fat. If you want to bring it more in line with an imperial battleship, I suggest reducing the body by 75%, then stretching out the X axis to 115mm long. This will cause a tad of distort in the valves/spiracles and the fin mounts
