Description :

~~~
Need an oil change or tire rotation? This business has got you covered whether you're driving a wheeled vehicle or a hovercar. This building is designed to be 3D printed as terrain for 6mm tabletop gaming. The top of the building is large and flat enough to support placing units on top in all hexes for playability. It is 1 level tall if you're playing a specific mecha tabletop game.

There are four files. One has the building on hexes, another is hexless so that you can print the one that fits your playstyle, and there are two more versions that have the text removed from the front of the building. Using the NoText versions, you can paint a custom name on the front, print off a logo to attach, or leave it blank to have a generic garage or commercial building.

As always, tipping is appreciated at: paypal.me/rainingfire416

Notable features:
-Based off of very popular Canadian and U.S. automotive service chains.
-Detailed design including front and rear garage doors, windows, and bollards to protect the building from bad drivers.

The model units are in mm and it is scaled such that the hexes are 33mm from flat-to-flat, which is perfect for modern hex maps using 33mm hexes. You can always resize it if your hexes are slightly smaller/larger.

Please post pictures and leave feedback if you make this yourself! I'd love to see prints and use the feedback to adjust overhangs, detail levels, etc. on this model and future ones as well.
