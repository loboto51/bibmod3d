"What are you Hungry?. I just fell down a hill. I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food. I have no food on me. I have nothing on me." -Dennis Nedry

Dilophosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in what is now North America during the Early Jurassic, about 193 million years ago. Length was up to 23 ft long and an estimated  Mass of 880 lbs.

Jurassic Park brought new recognition to the Dilophosaurus, being one of the coolest brought to life for the first film as well as my personal favorite. The Jurassic Park version shows a smaller version (could just be younger) that spit blinding venom, and had a frill that would unfurl when attacking, none of which are supported by the fossil record but did make a heck of a entertaining film so I am ok with it. This pose is meant to be reminiscent of the "fetch the stick stupid" scene in which the Dilo' looks over its shoulder at the stick. I like pose from this scene because the Dinosaur is still in its innocent puppy mode and shows off the mobility of its long neck also the frill isn't visible in that scene at all so this still fits..

You have some options to make different versions of the Dilo with the files I have provided:

 You can make a model the prints in parts that all pegs together. There is also a a high resolution fully assembled version (probably to big to properly preview with the "Thingview" sorry). It has higher quality details than most FFM printers can duplicate but if you have a resin printer or just want to play with the file to make a bigger version I feel this will be the most useful for you. I have also feature a Scaled up head it is about 1/2 the size of a real dilophosaurus or about 65%-75% the size of the Jurassic Park dilo, I printed one myself and it makes a great wall display.

As always I will promote and REWARD the first person to post a make (must enable tips on your profile for reward)

Update!: https://www.thingiverse.com/CH35C0 was the winner of this things  "First Make Award" check out their page for some cool and  practical designs!

Update! 2/11/19 Added a strait neck version.

His print in action! good use of meshmixer tree supports to save on cleanup.

If this proves popular, I will work on a version with a frill and an open mouth version. So Please post your makes, hit like, and provide feedback in the comments.

Thank you and enjoy!
