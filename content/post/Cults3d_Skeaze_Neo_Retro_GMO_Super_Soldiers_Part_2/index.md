Description :

~~~
A few more Neo-Retro super soldiers. This set includes a heavy machine gun, a shoulder mounted laser cannon, two leader with capes and different weapon options, an alternate plasma gun pose, and 2 alternate rifleman poses. These are my own sculpts (no remixing).

I've included 2 sizes. My usual "15mm" size are about 18.5mm at the eye, 20mm at the top of the head (they are intended to be bigger than normal 15mm humans). I made the 28mm size comparable to classic sculpts. If you want them closer to the size of new space marines you can always just scale them up a bit more.

*I currently ONLY have pre-supported files for the 15mm ones. All supported models have been test printed. I tend to go heavier on the supports. I recommend using the hot water method to remove them.
