Description :

~~~
Some head protection for your space dwarf warriors.  They can be printed at 100% and rotate in the socket slightly for posing.  If the meshes look like garbage that's because I'm a complete hack-fraud, I'm sorry. 

Update:
Added a YMYR embossed version at request.
Added a Fishbowl version at request and a blank version of the helmet in case anyone wants to make their own.  If you do- please share with the community! :)
Also didn't add pictures cause lazy.

Includes both supported and unsupported versions.  My supports are rudimentary but printed fine on my printer.
