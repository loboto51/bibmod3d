Description :

~~~
Pharaoh Fleet  - Isesi Class Light Cruiser - Supported.

Scaled to be a similar size to Battlefleet gothic ships or similar table top games. These will fill the role of the BFG a Necron ship.

Print in 2 parts.

2 x Engine

Part of the Pharaoh Fleet.  Clearly just a mash up of the 2 escorts while I was playing around.
Its a free sample so you if like it you might check out the rest of the fleet:

READY WITH A HOLE FOR A 2MM FLIGHT STAND THAT IS FAIRLY STANDARD. CAN INSTEAD BE FITTED WITH A 4MM MAGNET IF YOU MAGNETISE YOUR STANDS.
(I do have a free stand download but there are loads to pick from. The ones with a brass rod are a free download on my profile.)

Part of a themed fleet:
