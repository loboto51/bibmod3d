Description :

~~~
The Jackal class is a much larger and more unfortunately encountered vessel than the Dirge, having been present in every known encounter between the harvest fleets and the Imperial Navy. In addition to its fearsome weapons, it also carries an appreciable number of troops which are able to teleport aboard enemy vessels.

Might be ruining the goodwill I have from the wider BFG community with this. Good for BFG, better for Epic: Armageddon than the Dirge. Has a 3mm hole to fit standard GW flying stands.

2022-08-23: Added a version with smoother curves.
