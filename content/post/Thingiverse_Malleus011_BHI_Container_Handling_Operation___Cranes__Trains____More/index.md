Description :

~~~
Loads of containers and container handling goodness!  Stationary container cranes, walking container cranes, quad container haulers, container skates, container land trains, and more!  A variety of container stacks!  A confusing plethora of files!  These containers and handling equipment make a great container yard terrain setup, or just lots of small vehicles and scatter terrain to give your battlefields some life.

Models include:
The big stationary container crane is presented in several models, with the container 'rack' in different positions.  A seperate part is included for a container hanging from cables.

Quad mech 'walking' container cranes in several models.  They can also use the hanging container part if you print the version with no rack. (Its another quad industrial mech!)

The container Train is a multi-part model of a tractor and one or more trailers to make up a 'train' that is meant to service the stationary cranes.  Empty trailers are included along with those loaded with one or two containers.

Container Stackers are trucks with piston lifts that allow them to drive over single containers, or lift high enough to double-stack.  Handy for moving containers but can't stack as high as the big walking cranes.

Container skates are a variation of the mech skates (see the mech repair posting!) either loaded or unloaded; they're an alternative to the trains for moving containers and look best when being loaded/unloaded by the walking cranes.

Container stacks in different configurations and heights, along with a few single containers.

A Buildermech with a container flatbed is also included (See my Buildermech posting for lots of other options - the crane version would also be handy in a container yard.  Also, see my modular ships to have something the big cranes can offload!

Modeled in 6mm scale.
