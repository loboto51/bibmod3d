Description :

~~~
In the 31st century, this originally Canadian business has rebranded to be even more popular! This building is designed to be 3D printed as terrain for 6mm tabletop gaming. The top of the building is large and flat enough to support placing units on top for playability. It is 2 levels tall on the higher levels and 1 level tall on the lower levels if you're playing a specific mecha tabletop game.

This is a two part print. Part 1 of the building can be used standalone as any large commercial building if you print the version without text and a logo. Part 2 is an automotive center add-on that can be placed on either side of the main building to make it larger, as seen in the photos above.

There are six files. Two have the building sections on hexes, two are hexless so that you can print the ones that fits your playstyle, and there are two more versions of Part 1 that have the text removed from the front of the building. Using the NoText versions, you can populate your tabletop with custom commercial/big-box stores by painting names on the front or printing off logos to attach.

As always, tipping is appreciated at: paypal.me/rainingfire416

Notable features:
-Based off of a very popular Canadian business, using a similar font and building design style.
-Detailed design including large front windows, two main entrances, garage doors, windows, and bollards to protect the building from bad drivers.

The model units are in mm and it is scaled such that the hexes are 33mm from flat-to-flat, which is perfect for modern hex maps using 33mm hexes. You can always resize it if your hexes are slightly smaller/larger.

Please post pictures and leave feedback if you make this yourself! I'd love to see prints and use the feedback to adjust overhangs, detail levels, etc. on this model and future ones as well.
