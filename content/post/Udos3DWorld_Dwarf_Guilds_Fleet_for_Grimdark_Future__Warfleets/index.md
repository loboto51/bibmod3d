Description :

~~~
This is not an official release of OPR - this is my personal interpretation of how a Dwarf Guilds fleet in Warfleets might look like.

These ships were created with a non released version of an upcoming tool: The ship generator! Combining front, multiple mid, and back elements and adding stuff to them (like the turrets we have here, ...) will be super easy once there are compatible libraries and once that tool is finished. I will keep you updated on my patreon and these dwarf ships will definitely be the first library you can use!

You can download the bases here (I don't think it makes sense to include them here, too): https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/bases-for-grimdark-future-warfleets
