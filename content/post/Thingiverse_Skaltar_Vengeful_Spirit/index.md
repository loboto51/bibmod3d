Description :

~~~
Well the Big bad Warmaster needs a Big bad ship, doesn't come much bigger than this measuring 20cm in length, she is a beast. The Vengeful Spirit will make the enemies of Chaos weep. You will need a large printer for this, my Mars 2 Pro just about holds the model when split in two but to be honest to do this model justice it needs to be printed as a whole. Supports are a must especially on her stern area which will fail unless there are enough. Rules for this ship can be found online.
Enjoy her in your games
