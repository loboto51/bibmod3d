Description :

~~~
A frigate that can be used as a proxy for the Firestorm frigate.


The hull design is mine, the weapon batteries and turrets are attributed to Italianmoose. Not wanting to reinvent hot water, and his designs being super cool, I simply took them over and integrated them.


I thank him for being my source of inspiration.


The design is a little larger than the original and can serve as an escort cruiser, a type of vessel between the frigate and Dauntless-type cruisers.





The file has been print-tested, with no particular problems.





An improved version was submitted following this first print run.
