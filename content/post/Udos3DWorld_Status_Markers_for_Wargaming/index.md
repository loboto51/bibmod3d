Description :

~~~
Some marker to keep track of your unit's status. Was the unit already activated? Are my units frightened or even held down?

These markers fit to Grimdark Future ( https://www.onepagerules.com/games/grimdark-future ) and should cover all modes a unit can have (even from the advanced rules) but can also be used for other games.
