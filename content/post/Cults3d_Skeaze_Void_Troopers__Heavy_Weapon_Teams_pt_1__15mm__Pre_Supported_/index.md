Description :

~~~
This set contains a laser cannon and mortar, with a few different crew options. Models are in 15mm scale.

Part 2 with additional weapons and crew is now available here: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/void-troopers-heavy-weapon-teams-pt-2-15mm-pre-supported

There are both unsupported, and pre-supported* versions of each, including Lychee files.

*I tend to go heavier on the supports (I'd rather spend a little more time cleaning up supports than have a failure and have to completely re-print it). I use the "hot water method" for removing supports to make it easier. I can't guarantee it will work for all printers and resin though.
