Description :

~~~
Five strips of 10mm skeletons for Warmaster. One command strip and four regular ones. I also uploaded my first quick concept sketch, so actually six strips - a whole unit. I sculpted the skulls for the concept really fast, and even though they look a bit silly, I like them a lot.

I decided to follow the original GW layout, so there are seven warriors per strip. There are only 14 different poses though, and I learned something new while making them as well. Posing skeletons is fun.

I have not testprinted them yet, I hope the legs are sturdy enough.
