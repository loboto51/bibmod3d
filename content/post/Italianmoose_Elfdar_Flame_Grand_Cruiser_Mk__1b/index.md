Description :

~~~
Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for the ship the Flame of Asuryan for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. This model is bigger than the standard Dragons, from what I can tell it's supposed to be bigger. There are two versions, one with two sails on the outriggers and one with only the one sail per outrigger like the original model.
