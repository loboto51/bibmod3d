Description :

~~~
Dark Cathedral Fleet - Omega 13 Class Planet Destroyer

Scaled to be a similar size to Battlefleet gothic ships or similar table top games. This will fill the role of the BFG Planet Killer.

Printed in parts
1 x Prow
1 x rear
1 x Movable Core

Extra bits:
3 x turrets
3 x broadside
4 x Mast

There are 4 turret slots on the underside and 2 on top.

READY WITH A HOLE FOR A 2MM FLIGHT STAND THAT IS FAIRLY STANDARD. CAN INSTEAD BE FITTED WITH A 4MM MAGNET IF YOU MAGNETISE YOUR STANDS.
(I do have a free stand download but there are loads to pick from. The in the image is a plastic one from ebay)

FOR PERSONAL USE, NOT FOR RESALE AS A DIGITAL FILE OR PRINTED COPIES

Designer Notes:
The core is printed as a single file but it moves even after printing.  you can gently prise it apart if you want to make it easier to paint.  When together you can rotate it around itself.  Its only a bit of a novelty thing and not really to be spun at speed.  I am not responsible if you end up tearing a hole in the fabric of space!
When printed you load it into the hull from below into the channel .

EDIT:
22/09/23: Small Triple turret had an off centre peg. Have corrected.
