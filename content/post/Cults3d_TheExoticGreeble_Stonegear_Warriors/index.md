Description :

~~~
Quite common in any expedition fleet, Stonegear Warriors form the central spearhead of landing parties and exploration groups. Well suited to a variety of tasks and challenges, they are integral to both commercial and military operations. Originally trained to work difficult mines and high risk salvage operations, they quickly adapted to hostile environments. As mining fleets moved ever deeper into equally dangerous and lucrative areas, Stonegear Warriors have taken on a more offensive role. Clearing pockets of stubborn enemies, defending sub-space ore processing plants and neutralizing threats are only some of their many tasks.

This modular .STL set has 30 individual files. That includes, 12 weapon arms, 1 backpack with 4 accessories, 6 heads, 5 legs as well as the torso and a pauldron.

I've also included a crossover document that tells you which files to print if you want to cross over these to different game systems.

This is a replacement for my old Emberfolk Fighter set.

All files are available both pre-supported and unsupported for added flexibility. Lychee scenes are also included to tweak supports as needed.
