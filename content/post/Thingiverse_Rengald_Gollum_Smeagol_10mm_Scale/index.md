Description :

~~~
The Creature Gollum/ Smeagol the Stoorish Hobbit in 10mm Scale

This model was inspired by the Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring and some artwork seen online. It was produced for the LotR SBG but is in 10mm (epic) scale, not the standard 28mm scale. I know my sculpting isn't great but at that tiny scale, I think he gets the point across.

NOTE: This model has not been test printed.
