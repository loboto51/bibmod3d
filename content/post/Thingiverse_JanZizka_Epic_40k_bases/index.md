Description :

~~~
Assortment of bases for Epic 40k.

Please note that infantry bases are 40x10 mm or 45x15 mm instead of the traditional 40x12!
Also included 20x20 mm, 25x25 mm and 35x25 mm bases.

All bases are 2mm hight and beveled, holes in the infantry bases are 6 mm wide and 1 mm deep (shallow versions 0.5 mm deep, perfect for BaseDepartment models!)

Update 2020/09/16: Added 45x15 bases and standarized the file names.

Update 2021/01/15: Reuploaded all the files with a raised surface, so they can be printed flat on the bed and removed "easily". No need for supports and much improved precision.

UPDATE 2021/01/19: Added 57! decorated options for the 40x10 shallow bases, with an assortment of rocks and soldier corpses. Sources for these details are:
