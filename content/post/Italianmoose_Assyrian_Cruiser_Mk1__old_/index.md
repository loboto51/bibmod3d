Description :

~~~
Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for any of the cruisers for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. This is a little chunkier in design to make it easier to print on FFF printers. The segments all fit together, though they may need some filing depending on printer. There are two variants of thruster and four of the prow. The two prow patterns, with torpedo and plain prows.

2018-10-05 Added a version without the domes to act as a battlecruiser hull, can't believe I forgot!

2019-03-24 Added a new prow, with thicker ribs and a more sleek shape. Added extra bits to the engines to make the transition between the main hull and engines less jarring. There is also now a void for a pin underneath the hull. Check your slicer doesn't fill the hole, and drill through the circle on the lower hull.

2023-05-20 - Added headless and eagle-less prows on request for kitbashing. Enjoy!
