Description :

~~~
These are made with Loggyk's excellent Retro Renegade parts. They have been reproportioned to be close to the proportions of Moonjam's Galactic Crusaders, and scaled down to 15mm. I've included the .blend file, and a text document explaining how I scaled each part if you want to do your own.

As is they are a few millimeters taller than a normal 15mm human (equivalent to a Galactic Crusader at 225%). If you want them to be  more "true scale" (equivalent to GC's at 250%) you should scale them up 111%.

Update: Added special weapons and 2 sergeants. Separate Blender file for them as well. Additional parts by Mildseven, MKHand_Industries, BYRAMDAM, DavikDesigns. NGL I can't find where I got the plasma gun from.
