Description :

~~~
I've never been keen on the current model for this. The older resin version was better, but better still was the late 90s version by Tim Adcock. I've tried to recreate that version but using modern Space Elf designs.

The bulk of the model is Lord Cronos's beam hover tank from here:
https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/tiny-space-elves-beam-hover-tank
With the hover tank turret from here:
https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/tiny-space-elves-hover-tank
The fins at the back of the hull are based on the ones from this model:
https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/sprue-eldar-hornet
The dispensers are taken from here:
https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/space-elf-support-quasi-classic-platform-weapons

The model is the same scale as Lord Chronos's model on which it is based. For a more traditional 6mm scale, print it scaled to 80%.

The holes in the dispenser will probably need drilling out slightly to fit onto the mounting on the turret. The models all ought to fit but in practice I found that they don't. Alternatively try merging the web spinners with the turret and printing it as one piece.

Here and there the model is quite fragile, so take care when removing supports, assembling the parts or just handling the model.
