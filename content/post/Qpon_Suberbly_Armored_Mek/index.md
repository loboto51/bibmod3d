This is just a separate re-upload of the mek on my existing remix here: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/suberbly-armored-mek-and-nobz-remix 

Remix of the following:

Models can be split apart to mix and match equipment.

Models are a little top/front heavy and tend to fall forward before sticking them on bases. May need some posing/scaling adjustments to remedy this.

Check out my make below.

Tips and Makes are appreciated :)
