Description :

~~~
Scaled and repaired version for exposition purposes. Huge work.

You won't need any support, and its flat bottom too!!


UPDATE 2:
WRONG attributions! 
The original models came from Blackshmoll! 

You can check his designs here --> https://www.thingiverse.com/Blackschmoll


UPDATE: Just remember who liked this remix that Dutchmogul remade this set of dwarves to make them more printable (18mm, but scalable), take a look because this guy does some awesome work, he's on Open Sourced Tactic games and is making a very valuable contribution for the community.
