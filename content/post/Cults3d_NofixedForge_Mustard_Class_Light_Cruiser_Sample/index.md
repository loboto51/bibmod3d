Description :

~~~
Scaled to be a similar size to Battlefleet gothic ships or similar table top games.  This sample will fill the role of the BFG chaos light Cruiser.

Part of a themed fleet so if you like it you can see the other ships here:
https://cults3d.com/en/design-collections/NofixedForge/plague-cathedral

The ship can also be brought so you can build it how you want:
https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/mustard-class-light-cruiser

READY WITH A HOLE FOR A 2MM FLIGHT STAND THAT IS FAIRLY STANDARD. CAN INSTEAD BE FITTED WITH A 4MM MAGNET IF YOU MAGNETISE YOUR STANDS.
(I do have a free stand download but there are loads to pick from. The ones with a brass rod are a free download on my profile.)

Note: Based off my Dark Cathedral Fleet but reworked to look diseased.
