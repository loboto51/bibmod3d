Description :

~~~
The Imperial Navy relies on a modular hull for most of its classes of cruiser. Four side-slots and two spinal mounts allow for an exceptional variety of weapons bays while the armoured prow can take torpedoes, nova cannons, and even hydraulic-powered rams.

Initial model obtained from the steam workshop, scaled to length (6mm short on width) and most (hopefully all) holes patched up and cut up by myself. Weapons and other doodads are 100% from scratch. Comes with a 3mm hole for a flying stand or equivalent of your choice. 

Ideal for Battlefleet Gothic and Epic. For ideas on building configurations as well as Battlefleet Gothic game rules, I recommend the specialist arms forum:

27/09/2017: Added a heavier Lance turret that more resembles the original.
29/09/2017: Added sensor masts.
02/10/2017: Reshaped the prow, patched some newfound holes in the weapons bays.
12/01/2018: Detailed the prow. Added updated assembled hull per request.
