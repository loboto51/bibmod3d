Description :

~~~
A set of 30mm x 30mm RPG tiles for creating custom, themed RPG tile sets, bases, dioramas. Designed to represent sci-fi industrial complexes, atmosphere processors, spaceship decking, etc. Imagine teams of marines hunting for colonists whilst attacked from all sides by aliens, and you get the idea! 

Would work well with miniature based RPG games such as Space Hulk, Another Glorious Day in the Corps, Star Wars, 40k, Kill Team, Necromunda, etc. 

Compatible with my plain RPG modular board tile set:

Please see my other designs for a variety of other sci-fi and fantasy models.
