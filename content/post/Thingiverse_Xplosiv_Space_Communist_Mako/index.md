Description :

~~~
Space Communist Mako drone. This is just some random idea that I came up with. Could easily be a proxy for a Tau Sun Shark Bomber, Razorshark or even scale a bit down for a Remora. It is scaled to be about 8" wide. 

I included files for the whole model un-merged and chopped up for printing. 

For printing the chopped files the wing, front engine, missile, missile pod and lower antenna will need to be mirrored. 

I want to say thanks to all my followers as have pretty much have reached the 500 mark(3 away) You guys are the reason I keep at this and love seeing the positive feedback. 

Sorry its been a while since my last upload.  I took a break from modeling for a bit, and this has brought me back into it.  My next upload will be small and soon.  It will be a bits/parts pack for the common Space Communist greebles that will make remixing and modeling a little easier for beginners. Then after that its back to a big release of a complete Retributor Marine and weapons from the Astartes Youtube series done in pretty high poly.
