***See below Re: scale and statues***

Suitable in size (huge) and armament (basically none) to be a Universe-Class Mass Conveyor for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic, and also for games of Rogue Trader. You'll need to dig out your own statues to add, I recommend the following:

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2718906

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3413744

You'll either need to smush them together or tweak them separately and glue them the old-fashioned way. There's two slots either side of the prow, one on the prow upper face behind the large antenna, and one near the stern on the large flat platform. See the render for some examples.

With regards to scale, the BFG scaling is logarithmic so smaller vessels are oversized and larger ones are undersized. This keeps model sizes managable. This model is ~130 mm long, however for a more "correct" size it should be around 200 mm (1.5x).
