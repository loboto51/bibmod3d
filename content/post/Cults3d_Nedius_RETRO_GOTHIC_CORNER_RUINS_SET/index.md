Description :

~~~
A complete collection of retro-themed Gothic Ruins for table top gaming. These are the full set of 20 ruins that make up the full set of the sample set released earlier, available here: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/retro-gothic-corner-ruins-set-1 

Included in this set are 20 corner ruins, the floor piece for the raised platform on the two tallest corner ruins, plus two floor templates in case anyone wants to break them up a bit for some floor details on the ground level. 

Inspired by the cardboard terrain I used in my youth, these turn those 2D flat terrain pieces into fully 3D models, to look more fitting on a modern gaming table!

Scaled to suit 28mm-32mm models, I actually designed them to be printed out at 50% scale for 15mm gaming. They even work well all the way down to 25% scale for 8mm gaming! 

Perfect for reliving past wargaming experiences, or for giving your current games a bit of a Retro theme!

Please check out my other wargaming models including the first part of this set, and if you like this set, please consider liking the file, following me, or even making a donation! I love seeing what people do with my models, so please post a make once you've printed them out. I am an amateur, hobby-level designer, and any support helps keep me motivated and supports the hobby activities I can do! Thanks!
