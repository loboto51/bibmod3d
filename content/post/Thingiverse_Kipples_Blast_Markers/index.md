Description :

~~~
I got frustrated with the lack of decent blast markers out there so I asked TimsTanks if he would kindly let me remix his:

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4532903

I'm pretty much a MeshMixer noob so apologies for the mess. I did some fixed versions in MeshMixer and various other programs but was worried they might muck up as they print fine as they are in my experience (as you can see from the photos). If anyone with more skill wants to fix them/make them solid for greater utility feel free. I did a load of versions and obviously you can mirror them for even more variety. If you want to donate, please do it to TimsTanks. Ta.
