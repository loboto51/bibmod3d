Description :

~~~
Four  Tanky Skimmers humming by!

 There are two Hulls included, main difference being the placment
of the turret, HummerHull 1 is off center, HummerHull 2 is perfectly centered.

All the four versions have an fully assembled model included, but you also get the turrets and gun mounts separately, as well as full gun turrets.

So printing turrets and guns separately, allows you to pose the gun at a wanted angle. A ready gun turret naturally has the guns angle fixed. 

Also all files come with a pre-supported option.
Four printable bases included 


Suitablr for 6-8mm
