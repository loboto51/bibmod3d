Description :

~~~
Privateers are ressourceful individuals who can find and deploy many ships from different backgrounds. Modified cargo vessels can bring the good stuff in the most heated situations and at great speed. Ancient military escorts are, despite their age still feared by pirates for their resilience while small raiders are both cheap and fast making them highly ubiquitous.

**This pack includes :**
- 3x privateer cargo vessels ;
- 3x small raiders ;
- 3x old military frigates.

The escorts are between 35mm and 40mm long and can be used to proxy Rogue Trader escorts for Battlefleet Gothic. You can also use them to add small ships to your pirate fleet or add flavor to your space stations.

_ The files are unsupported and come with a slot for 3mm or 1/8 inch stem.
