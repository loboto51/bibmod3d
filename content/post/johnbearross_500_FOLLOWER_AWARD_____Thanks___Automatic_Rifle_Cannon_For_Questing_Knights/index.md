Description :

~~~
I want to thank you folks for helping me reach 500 followers after only a month of paid sales.

As a token of appreciation, here's the RFBC-500 Avtomat Pushka (sorry, my computer-translated Russian is terrible), an Automatic Rifle Cannon (RFBC proxy).

It's available in both Right (A) and Left (B) versions, with the main weapon body having a choice of stick or drum magazine.

Also, one of my heavy stubby gatlings is incorporated into the design.  That asymmetric part of the design is a nice feature, in my opinion.

A pair of weapon arms, long and short, are supplied, as well as upper arms at a variety of angles for magnetization.

I glue the ball and sockets together, then glue 12mm x 2mm magnets to the bottom of the upper arm.

An 8mm x 2mm magnet will fit in the face of the main weapon body.  I usually glue in washers in the barrel section.  4mm inner diameter/9mm outer diameter washers usually do it, or #6 washers.  Or just glue them together and print more.

You can use opposing magnets in the weapon arms (remember opposite poles) to the new upper arms.  I recommend 12mm x 3mm magnets.

Enjoy, and thanks again!  More good stuff to come.

Best,
JBR

P.S. Check out my other Knight parts, most of which are free.

P.P.S.  I started a Discord server for feedback and for folks to follow progress of my sculpts.

P.P.P.S.  I have updated the upper arms to ensure compatibility with Project Quixote, my new modular mech kit.  Check it out.
