Description :

~~~
The M.A.D.C.A.T. (Medical Assistance and Diagnosis Cyber-Altered Task) is the latest innovation in Squat medical technology. A robotic unit (not heresy), all-terrain, portable (if you have a Rhino, Chimera or a large backpack) and capable of taking an ER wherever it is needed. Equipped with a whole collection of sharp, pointy and no doubt painful things, the M.A.D.C.A.T. It is designed to assist Squats medical teams in their daily tasks, providing comprehensive diagnosis and hands-on support to treat virtually any field situation, no matter how serious.

As long as it's not reattaching heads and necks, regenerating vaporized limbs, or picking up pieces of you scattered everywhere.

Update 06/14/23: As you can see in the pictures, this thing is printable. My FDM couldn't print the bellows for some reason, so I made an alternative "hull" model with these parts simpilfied. I don't think this is a problem for resin printers.  

Just dont forget that removing supports is part of the fun and you need to break some..."eggs" to make an omelette. A very tiny plastic omelett with even tinier plastic eggs.
