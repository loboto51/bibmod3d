Description :

~~~
10mm minotaur characters for warmaster revolution (intended as counts-as ogre kingdoms)

based on https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/labyrinth-guardians

I included a mounted version of the hero and shaman (butcher), although the mounted hero is simply "cav3.stl" from the heavy cavalry unit. Base these on a standard 40x20mm stand as per the rules. A "rhinox" mounted char simply isn't going to fit on a 20/25mm round base.

I haven't printed these specific stls yet but have printed the ones they're based on successfully, so I don't expect any issues. If you do encounter some let me know!
