_This file is not pre-supported! And is not scaled to correct size!_

Note: I've only added detail. The original model was lowpoly from jimjimjimmyjim on thingiverse.

I'm short of resin and don't plan to print it for a few months. When I go to print it I will add Supports and update the model. 

In the meantime, it doesn't hurt to share it. When you put supports, you could also make it hollow and put some holes in the bottom. 

PS: Yeah, it is a female toad...
