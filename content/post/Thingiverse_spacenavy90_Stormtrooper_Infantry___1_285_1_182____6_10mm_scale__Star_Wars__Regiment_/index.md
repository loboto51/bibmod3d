Description :

~~~
This is an Imperial Stormtrooper scaled for the Epic-scale wargame Star Wars: Regiment. 
It is scaled at about 1:285 or 6mm scale and also 1:182 or 10mm.
This trooper is intended for a 25mm round base with infantry stand holes (you can find some to print here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7079406)

I printed this on my Saturn 4 Ultra, at this scale it is highly recommended to print in resin. I have included pre-supported files for both sizes.
This model was created using an image produced by ChatGPT, inputted into Hitem3D, and then manually sculpted, rigged and posed in Blender.
Over time I will add additional poses to this file to give the unit more variety in basing. I thought the result was interesting enough to share as a work-in-progress.

**Star Wars: Regiment** is an epic-scale modification of *Star Wars: Legion*, modified for fielding full infantry companies, and vehicle platoons in large cinematic battles. The game supports 6mm (1:285) scale miniatures, with free STLs for 3D printing, full digital support through Tabletop Simulator and a web-based army builder.
