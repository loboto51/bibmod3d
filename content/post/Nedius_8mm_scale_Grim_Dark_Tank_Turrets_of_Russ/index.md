Description :

~~~
Rumbling forward on heavy tracks, the tanks of the Imperial Army are capable of decimating enemy forces with overwhelming firepower. The versatile main battle tank is capable of being adapted to house a great range of weaponry, ensuring the right tool is available to tackle any foe. Whether busting bunkers, demolishing buildings, bathing entrenched foes in flames or caustic chemicals, or melting through armour plate, there is a turret for every occasion.

This is a set of tank turrets featuring 15 weapon options, plus two with additional coaxial cannons, making a total of 17 weapon load outs. Each of those comes with optional designs, making this set of over 60 STLs!

These have been made to be compatible with 8mm scale main line battle tanks of the Imperial Army in a recently released 8mm grim-dark future wargame.   They feature a magnet hole, and a peg compatible with existing plastic model hulls. The 'open hatch' designs (usually noted as designs A or C) fit the plastic hatch options for the same main battle tank, allowing for use of spare bits and personalisation. Options B and D usually feature build-in closed hatches for those who want to keep things simple. There are also two slightly different desings, allowing for some variety in turret apperance (A and B are design 1, C and D design 2) as well as designs with fuel barrels or energy generators. 

The weapon options are:

Battle cannon
Vanquishing cannon
Building Demolisher cannon
Twin laser cannons
Twin light cannons
Plasma cannon
Punishing Gatling cannon
Incinerating energy cannon
Eradicating heavy cannon
Conqueror medium cannon
Huntsman flamer cannon
Twin heavy bolt gun
Chemical cannon
Melta cannon
Anti-aircraft flak cannon (fixed + posable versions)


Also included is a static bunker turret emplacement, allowing spare turrets to be added to your battlefield as terrain or support artillery.

I've priced this cheaply, but priced it as a reflection of the time I took to create such an extensive set. I deeply appreciate all those who support and encourage my work by buying any of my paid designs.

Please see my other items for a free sample of this set, and a range of other 8mm scale and other wargames and hobby models. I am an enthusiastic amateur designer, self and video-tutorial taught, so am always open to constructive feedback.

Please consider liking the design and posting a make.
