Description :

~~~
This model is the result of a fever dream I had after watching Wild Wild West, specifically i was inspired by the Dr. Loveless's Derailer steam tank, which i thought it have a lot of Chaos Dwarfs vibes.

My version is a masive daemon engine, powered by enslaved demons wich are not very happy about the idea, so it's also filled with hatred and a desire for revenge.

Experimental rules included in english y español!

NOTE: There are a lot of .stl, i know, but for some reason Thingverse dont allow me to upload compressed .zip files
