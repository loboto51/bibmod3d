Description :

~~~
Tartarus Fleet - Revenant Class Battleship.

Scaled to be a similar size to Battlefleet gothic ships or similar table top games. These will fill the role of the BFG chaos Battleship
To build the ship you need:
1 x Top Section
1 x mid section
1 x lower section
1 x prow.  There are 2 versions to pick from

Options to fill the broadside slots:

1 x Launch bay module. (mirror for the other side)
1 x weapon bay module
1 x Single Turret with weapons module - 3 x turrets to fit
3 x smaller turret option. These will fit the bare slots better.
1 x Cargo Module

Extra bits that will fit into the slots :
2 x Mast
1 x Radome

If you dont want to fit broadsides on the top the "Dante Turrets" will fit in the bare modules.

READY WITH A HOLE FOR A 2MM FLIGHT STAND THAT IS FAIRLY STANDARD. CAN INSTEAD BE FITTED WITH A 4MM MAGNET IF YOU MAGNETISE YOUR STANDS.
(I do have a free stand download but there are loads to pick from)  I have used a 2mm brass rod in the photos.  The base is a free download.

FOR PERSONAL USE, NOT FOR RESALE AS A DIGITAL FILE OR PRINTED COPIES

Designer notes:

You may want to paint before sticking together. The internal hangars can be seen inside before assembly.

The Battleship comes with an optional cargo module to fit on the lower hull below near the rear. It bulks the hull out and ships in space need extra cargo! It will accept other broadsides but it might look odd with a weapons one there due to the angle. I do have 2 other cargo styles that are sold separately
