Description :

~~~
Behold the demonic Hellfire Cannon of the evil dwarfs!

Comes with three crew, chains to shackle it down and in place. Instructions included for some tips on assembly. Cannon will come out about 100 x 100mm, shackles and crew will expand that but will look good on a 100 x 150mm base.

This includes BOTH 28mm and 10mm versions. 

Supported and unsupported zip files included. All supported files have printed successfully. 

10mm version doesn't include chains but has been modified with a number of strengthening modifications for such a small scale.

Happy printing!
