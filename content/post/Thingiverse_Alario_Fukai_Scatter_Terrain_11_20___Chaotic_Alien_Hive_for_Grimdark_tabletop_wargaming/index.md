Description :

~~~
Six years ago, I remixed the very first pieces of Fukai scatter terrain from the work of AxoloteGaming and onebitpixel.
They were a raw experiment in organic, alien-inspired structures—and to my surprise, they spread across the hobby world like wildfire.
Since then, they’ve been downloaded millions of times and used to build entire themed tables.

Today, I’m bringing them back—remastered.

🔧 What’s new?

Sharper, cleaner surface lines to make painting easier (washes and drybrushes pop much better now).

More consistent detailing across each piece for a stronger visual impact.

Optimized meshes for smoother printing results.

This is just the beginning—I plan to gradually rework the entire collection to bring it up to the same standard.

And if you want to go even further into the Fukai universe, don’t miss the ongoing Kickstarter campaign:
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alario/fukai 

The campaign includes a complete playable biome with modular buildings, ruins, props, and tournament-ready layouts—all designed to expand and complement the free scatter terrain.
