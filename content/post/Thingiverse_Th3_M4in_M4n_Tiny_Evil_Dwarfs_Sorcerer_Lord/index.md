Description :

~~~
A SORCERER LORD!

BECAUSE WHY HAVE A SIMPLE GENERAL IF FOR 25 MORE POINTS YOU CAN TURN HIM INTO A POWERFUL WIZARD?!

Furthermore, it is not only the sorcerer, but I have taken the task of designing a floating magical platform powered by demonic fire to transport the Sorcerer Lord across the battlefield with speed and comfort, from a privileged position to command the armies at his feet. 

In game terms, it is not supposed to be a flying unit, but simply to stand out above the rest so that it is clear who it is.

I designed the platform from scratch and using some bits taken from here and there. For the Sorcerer Lord I used the "Dwarf Wizard" model created by Tom Wiggins as a base and edited it a little.


NOTE: Be VERY careful when removing the supports from the Sorcerer Lord, the staff can break easily.
