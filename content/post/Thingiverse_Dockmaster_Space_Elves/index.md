Description :

~~~
Space elves for your favorite spaceship battle game.

I haven't tried printing these yet, so there may be updates on the way if I encounter any challenges over the next couple of weeks.

12/20/2017 updated many of the files as the dorsal fins were too thin to properly slice in Cura.

12/20/2017 Another round of updates. I've been printing like a madman and found a few issues. I've thickening up main wings, separating the wings from the escorts (too easy to break while removing the supports). Also Added a grand cruiser suitable for BFGXR.

12/27/2017 Hopefully the final set of updates. After printing myself a small fleet, I've slightly scaled down the size on the cruisers and made a variant for a 2 winged light cruiser (makes them much easier to identify on the table)

1/06/2018 Added a transport ship to the roster.

1/12/2018 Added an updated version of the battleship with separate fins.
