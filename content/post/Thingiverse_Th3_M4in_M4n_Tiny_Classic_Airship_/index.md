Description :

~~~
Since Cults3D has disabled my access to my account (again), and it's very unlikely that they will give me any explanation about it, I decided to give up on cotinue making profit wiht that platform or any other, so i will release all the models I've been selling starting with this one.

This is a Dwarf airship/zeppelin sculpted from scratch, very inspired in the model made by Forgeworld in the early 2000s. I used only few pictures as reference, so is not exactly like that one but close enough, with some little differences. I added experimental rules (in english y español) to use it ingame; any feedback will be very appreciated.
