Description :

~~~
Not the best weapon for Smaller Knights, but I am a completionist.  This is the last one on my list.

The C-Beamer is a relic weapon usually overlooked because it does more damage the farther away the target is, and less up close, which is a disadvantage on the close-range, terrain-choked tabletops of the current edition.

But, it's free.  ;)

Supported versions have a lot of tiny sub-supports that you will want to flick out after curing, especially on barrel 3.  It seemed the only way to save that spiraling effect.

You might not be able to access or paint the interior cages of barrels 2 or 3.  If that is unacceptable, I recommend barrel 1.  It's cleaner and sleeker.

Everything is included from the shoulder socket down.

Ball and socket upper arms are included, in case you want to keep a fixed, glued pose.

I recommend the flat-elbowed upper arms, and magnetizing with an 8mm x 2mm or 8mm x 3mm neodymium magnet glued to the fused upper arm, and steel magnets glued to the elbow "socket" of the weapon.  

I usually glue a steel BB in the socket, then cap it with a pair of glued-on steel washers.  See pics for reference.

You'll lose some poseability, but gain modularity.

Also, check out my other mech and knight parts, most of which are free.

Enjoy!
