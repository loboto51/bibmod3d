Description :

~~~
Only encountered by the Imperial Navy in a handful of recorded occasions, the Shroud is a particularly worrisome foe not for its destructive power (which is excessive, like all necron vessels) but as it is able to pick out minute vulnerabilities in the most invulnerable defences for the rest of its comrades to exploit.

With this the necron fleet is finally finished. The least satifactory of the necron designs, I could never figure out an angle for the side wing-disks that felt right. Good for Battlefleet Gothic, or use it for orbital support in Epic: Armageddon. 

Sorry, no assembled .stl because saving with the side wing-disks at their funny angle causes unintended mesh abominations.
