Description :

~~~
Dwarf Bolt Throwers!

Because you dont bring a cannon to hunt a dragon, but very big crossbows on wheels!

Bolt Trhowers are a lore friendly thing in dwarf armies, so i wanted a unit of these. No experimental rules here, just use the same ones as any other Bolt Thrower. 

Literally print and play. 

Also i inlcude the crew to operate the bolt throwers, and two printable bases in the case you want mount yours like in the pics; these were designed to fit the stile of the grassy bases made by Porblegames (
