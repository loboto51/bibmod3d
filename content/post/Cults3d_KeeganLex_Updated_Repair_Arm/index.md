Description :

~~~
An updated version of my previous (now deactivated) file pack for a robotic arm which I made months back.  Besides fixing some geometry and STL file issues which were present in the first pack, I also decided to add some additional details to it.  The components of the arms are left separate to hopefully avoid non manifold geometry issues as well as allowing anyone to separate the arms for reposing.  The claw is also separate from the arm now, allowing some extra freedom in posing.  The base and arm also have a slot for a 6mmx3mm circular magnet to keep the two parts together without needing to permanently attach them.

Hope you all enjoy this one and feel free to reach out to me if you encounter any issues with the models.  Enjoy
~~~
