Description :

~~~
An office tower designed to be 3D printed as terrain for 6mm tabletop gaming. The top of the building is large and flat enough to support a unit placed on top for all 14 hex locations. It is 4 levels tall on the shorter section and 6 levels tall on the taller section if you're playing a specific mecha tabletop game.

There are two files. One has the building on hexes and the other is hexless so that you can print the one that fits your playstyle. Further, there are second and third variations of this building, uploaded as “Office Tower 3A” and "Office Tower 3C" here:

3A: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4598329
3C: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4598327

The difference between the three buildings is that the two tower sections of 3A are only 4 levels tall, and for 3C both tower sections are 6 levels tall.

Notable features:
-Detailed design including doors, windows, steps to a raised platform around the building, and a roof with ducting.

The model units are in mm and it is scaled such that the hexes are 33mm from flat-to-flat, which is perfect for modern hex maps using 33mm hexes. You can always resize it if your hexes are slightly smaller/larger.

Please post pictures and leave feedback if you make this yourself! I'd love to see prints and use the feedback to adjust overhangs, detail levels, etc. on this model and future ones as well.
