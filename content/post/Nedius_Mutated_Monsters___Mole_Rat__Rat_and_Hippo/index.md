Description :

~~~
The Wastes are home to all manner of terrible creatures, mutated from what were once the humble creatures of the forests. Whether this was by design, genetic mutation, or simply through exposure to chaotic magics is unknown. 

This is a collection of mutated beasts, designed for Fantasy and Post-Apocalyptic Wargaming and RPGs. They are truly massive beasts, and so are provided both whole, in kit form, and with hollowed out versions  to allow you to chose the right set for your needs. These were made whilst making my toad-dragon (link below), as each time I looked at it, it made me think of a different animal! I saw a rat, molerat, and hippo, and here they are!

I love settings in post apocalyptic fallout shelters, where desert mole rats have mutated into massive beasts, so have a particular fondness for the mole-rat monster here - perfect for creating a monstrous mount for your post apocalyptic raiders or travelling merchants!

The Toad Dragon can be found here:

These models come without rider or saddle, and are designed to be kit-bashed with your favourite fantasy range. These parts are also compatible with the bits from the Toad Dragon, and so would complement it nicely. 

Please see my other designs for other wargaming STLS, including maggots, tics and flies suitable for adding even more detail to this model, or to decorate your army's bases.

I am an amateur enthusiast 3D designer, and appreciate all support and constructive feedback. Please check out my other designs for more wargame models, and please consider following me, post a make, and enjoy my models. If you would like to support my work, please leave a comment, like the design, or make a donation via my profile! Thanks!
