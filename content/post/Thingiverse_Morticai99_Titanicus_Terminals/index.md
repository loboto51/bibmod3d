Description :

~~~
These are remixes of the terminals by  Jymacdougall, and all credit should go to him for the amazing designs.  Keep in mind these are based on the Grand Master Terminals so are a bit bigger than the standard ones.  For the warhound, I corrected errors in the text and modified the token slots to take 3x1mm magnets instead of pegs.  The Reaver is pretty much made from scratch but printed out fine.  Also included are 3 different custom tokens I made for the different tracking types.

-Resin Printers: I had some issues with warping on the edge towards the plate.  To solve this, I added a break away wedge to one end.  These are the STL's labelled with "R".  If you angle the terminal with the wedge towards the plate, the wedge should warp instead of the terminal, then just break off the wedge when it's done.

-FDM Printers: If you want the smaller text to be legible, you're going to have to use a .2 nozzle so be prepared for a fairly long print time.  Don't forget to change the settings in your slicer or risk a major clog.

I do plan on making a Warlord terminal when I get some time.
