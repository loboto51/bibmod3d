Description :

~~~
6mm skimmer skiffs for your tiny evil space elves to fly amock and be absolute jerks to everybody.

This set includes

3 hull variants, each with transport and gunship versions.
4 sail variants, with hole for 2x1mm round magnet or a simple peg
6 different drivers to steer the skiff towards your targets
6 bow gunners each with a shadow laser and disintegration beam option. 
6 side gunners for extra mayhem, each with 2 weapon options.
3 styles of bases, plain, net and blade, each in 3 poses. 

The sails can be printed with a peg and glued in place, but I recommend using 2x1 round magnets, this makes them much less likely to break off, and you can pose and swap them if you feel like it.

Supported files are currently NOT included. The bases should print without supports but the rest will need to be supported before printing.

The detail on these should look good to about 15mm if scaled up, any larger (like 28mm) and they will start to look awfully bobblehead and disproportion. 

Hopefully more to come soon!
