Description :

~~~
This looks _suspiciously_ like my [Modular Utility Building](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6838588), don't you think?  
OK, yeah, I fancied having one that was full height - that is, the same height as a GW Sector Fronteris hab block, and therefore also the same height as a [Fronteris style bunker](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6988922). It is, very approximately, 60x60x70mm.  
For my own use I thought I'd go all in on the vents; make it some sort of cooling tower type thing, with a simple style vaguely influenced by some belfry louvres. I've kept in some more basic walls too, if that's more your style (or you plan to embellish them yourself).

### Compatibility

Style-wise, it obviously takes heavy cues from the Sector Fronteris hab units.

The pipe ports are the standard size expected on GW's 40k terrain - 25.6mm diameter.

The side pipe ports have a centre-line height of 14.5mm, which matches other terrain, e.g. Thermic Plasma Conduits.. Their outer face is 30.5mm from the centre point, so if you have two opposite each other they'll be 61mm apart, which should be a familiar size to those used to e.g. Sector Mechanicus components.

The roof is the same height as that of a Sector Fronteris hab unit, and the roof with a port should match the ports on those hab units too. 

### Assembly

You will need:
* 4x *pillars*
* 4x *walls*
* 1x *roof*
If you chose walls with *ports*, you'll also need
* 1+ *pipe ends*

Walls push into pillars from behind. I recommend putting the roof in unglued as you put together the rest, then gluing it in last.

Pillars can be mirrored for a bit more variety. 

### Pre-supports

The supported files here are the way I did them for myself, successfully. Is it the best? No. The walls and pillars are definitely over-supported, but I wasn't going to go back and change something that worked.

As you may see from the pictures, I did _not_ print non-louvred walls. The supports have been applied in the same way, but I have not actually printed these specifically.

### FAQ

* What's with the extra holes on the pipe ports in the photos but not on the STLs?
   _I have bizarre hopes of putting a lot of magnets everywhere. I'm not doing this in a way that I think makes sense to most people, so I didn't think it was worth sharing those. You can have the clean ones that actually look good by themselves!_
