Description :

~~~
Genetically engineered Marines travel throughout Space, battling depraved heretics, dishonourable traitors, and vile aliens.

This set includes 4 powered gauntlets, two holding the torn off heads of two different types of alien beast - a brutal ork, and a sinister soulstealer. The third holds a retro style space beaky helmet, and the fourth is empty, perhaps for you to add in your own head model! All four have supported versions.

This is an updated version of the first thing I ever tried to 'sculpt', as opposed to arrange geometric shapes - an ork head. It's a little reflection on my part, comparing where I started to where I am. It's been a slow process, as I take what digital hobby time I can in between physical modelling and all my other fickle interests! But it's still nice to see what I feel in some improvement.

I am an amateur enthusiast 3D designer, and appreciate all constructive feedback. Please check out my other designs for more wargame models, and please consider following me, posting a make, or even leaving a donation via my profile!
