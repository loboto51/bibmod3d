Description :

**Glade-S, civilian HC**

This file is a remix & remaster of a file originally made by [Pietia](https://www.thingiverse.com/Pietia). I had looked at this 28mm scale model Cyberpunk Sci-Fi car and thought that it would be a cool design to adapt and remix as a civilian-model Sci-Fi hover car for use at 6mm scale.

**About the Design.** I have taken the original 3D model by Pieta and remastered it slightly, adapting it more for the 6mm scale size where some of the detail at 28mm scale was either redundant or required some further adjusting to account for detail creep or dissolution (if printed). I then created the Hovercraft 'skirt' separately and melded these two main feature components together. Finally, I created some other new detail features as well as further adjusting some of the existing features to bring it all together more holistically as an integrated overall design that works on its own.

And voila! hopefully, it does.

**Other Designs.** This model set is intended to be compatible with the other 6mm (true-scale) and Hex(33) (hex scale) SciFi terrain sets that I have released on [Cults 3D](https://cults3d.com/en/users/Shiaic3D/creations) and other locations, [GumRoad](https://shiaic3d.gumroad.com/), [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@Shiaic3D/models) and [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/shiaic1/designs).

Please search my other designs for more models of a similar type and theme.

****************
**Creativity Powered by Patreon.** This model is a remix of free files and parts available elsewhere. However, the time and effort to remix them into a model set like this were enabled with the support of my generous [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Shiaic3D) backers, who gain exclusive access to remixes like this for a temporary period well before it is released wider.

Please check out my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Shiaic3D) if you want to support the creation of more remix projects like this, or gain access to my other remastered works and/or unique terrain creations for 6mm tabletop wargaming.

**Leave a Tip.** Alternatively, please feel free to leave a tip if you like this model and think it is merited (and don't forget to tip any original designers) - an occasional coffee helps fuel the creative effort and sustains morale :)

**Other Files.** Additionally, if you want to find more of my unique 6mm wargame terrain and building creations and other 3D designs, check out my [GumRoad](https://shiaic3d.gumroad.com/) shop or please also see my other unique designs on [Cults 3D](https://cults3d.com/en/users/Shiaic3D/creations). For a small cost (about half a coffee), I have a few re-detailed and remastered 6mm vehicle and FightMech models, such as:
