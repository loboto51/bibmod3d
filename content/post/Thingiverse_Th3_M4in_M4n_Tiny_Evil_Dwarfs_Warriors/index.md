Description :

~~~
Warmaster has caught my attention for a while, and i decided to make my own little armies to play. I have decided to start with the Chaos Dwarves since there are enough free models to build an army, and specifically, I have used the incredible models designed by Fabelzel (among others) as the basis of this first example of what I intend to create.

So, I proudly present to you these CHAOS DWARFS WARRIORS :D!

My idea is to make armies for Warmaster Revolution, so I will design them according to what is indicated in the current available army lists. I already have other units and heroes in the oven, so it is a matter of time to have a basic army ready to play.


* GOOD LUCK PAINTING TINY HATS.
