Description :

~~~
My Crafty World needed to recruit some Wasps, but a regular walker was needed as a base to start from - 
Feel free to use this as a proxy unit in it's own right, or a base for a wasp kit (mine will be upped soon enough!)

This is an original sculpt and NOT a 1:1 of the official kit, but most parts are interchangeable to a degree, so this can be used to provide spare bits for a retail kit with a little filing if you've had an accident :)

The model is provided for free, but even so I would appreciate if you shared the link rather than the model itself, thanks :)

Also, while it's free, please feel welcome to buy me a coffee to help fuel the next one! (link in Bio)
