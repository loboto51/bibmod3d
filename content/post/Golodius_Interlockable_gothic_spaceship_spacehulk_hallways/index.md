Description :

~~~
A modular set of parts for dungeon crawling in the icy void of space.


These parts use OpenLOCK clips to assemble.


You'll find the clip in the 4-Others folder.


https://www.printablescenery.com/product/open-lock/





The pieces do not use the tile system per se.





This set allows you to play games such as Space Hulk, games in the Zone Mortalis environment, Necromunda and other Warhammer 40k SF dystopian universes.





For Space Hulk players, here you'll find everything you need to redo all the missions from V1 and its expansions.


Parts will be added as we go along, enabling you to play the game's 2 expansions.


This being done on my own time, thank you for understanding my pace of adding pieces.





The squares are 33x33 mm, which is a good compromise between the volume of filament required and good playability.


The whole thing can be scaled to suit your aspirations.
