Description :

~~~
The Dirge class raider is a small vessel that like all harvest vessels will give and take punches above its weight class; if its opponents can catch up to it. Thankfully for the Imperial Navy it is rarely encountered, and even rarer in significant numbers.


Of all the factions present in BFG, the fleet most people would tell me to leave alone. Find them in BFG: Armada (the book, not the computer game). In a pinch can also be used to give orbital support in games of Epic Armageddon. Comes with a 3mm hole to support standard flying stands.
