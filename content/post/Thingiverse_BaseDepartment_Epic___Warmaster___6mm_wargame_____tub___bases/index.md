Description :

~~~
Update: I changed them to be 2mm high, the bottom is now 0,4mm high and the outer walls still 0,8.
They're now perfect to print with a 0,4mm nozzle and 0,2mm layer height.
I added all the earlier 1,5mm versions to a zip file, they still work perfectly fine.

Annoyed by having to fill the little gaps on hole bases for infantry models or by adding to much mass on top when adding more creative base designs?
Look no further! These bases have huge holes instead of small ones, so you can just fill the entire top of the base with Green Stuff/Milliput/Tamiya-Putty or whatever you like!

They're probably best printed with FDM but they should also work with SLA printers, I only tested them with FDM so far.

!MAKE SURE TO LET THEM COOL OFF INSTEAD OF PULLING THEM OFF THE BUILDPLATE WHILE THEY'RE STILL WARM OR THEY WILL END UP BEING BENT!

I used pretty old dried up Green Stuff for the example picture, so please excuse that it looks terrible.

If you want any other size just post a coment and I'll make it for you.
