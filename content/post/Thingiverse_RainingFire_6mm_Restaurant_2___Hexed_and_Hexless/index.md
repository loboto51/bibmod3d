Description :

~~~
Triple F Burger! The most popular fast food joint in the Federated area! This building is designed to be 3D printed as terrain for 6mm tabletop gaming. The top of the building is large and flat enough to support a unit placed on top for all 4 hex locations. It is 1 level tall if you're playing a specific mecha tabletop game.

There are eight files. Four versions of the building - on and off hexes both with and without text. Two large F statues as decorations - one on a hex and one without a hex. And two large "triple F" billboards - one on a hex and one without a hex.

The building versions with text may only look good when printed in resin, so if you print with FDM you may prefer to print the NoText files. In that case, you can paint a name on the front, print off a logo to attach, or leave it blank.

Notable features:
-Detailed design including doors, windows, drive-through window with bollards, a ladder to the roof, and a detailed roof with greebles.
-The F statue is on a small pedestal with 3 flower boxes and benches. These would look best if you flock it nicely or add miniature flowers or shrubs.
-The large F statue is 2 levels tall but will not support a unit. It is meant as a decoration. It will require a little support to print nicely.
-The billboard is also 2 levels tall and may support a unit if you are careful, but it is also meant as a decoration. It will require a little support to print nicely.

The model units are in mm and it is scaled such that the hexes are 33mm from flat-to-flat, which is perfect for modern hex maps using 33mm hexes. You can always resize it if your hexes are slightly smaller/larger.

Please post pictures and leave feedback if you make this yourself! I'd love to see prints and use the feedback to adjust overhangs, detail levels, etc. on this model and future ones as well.
