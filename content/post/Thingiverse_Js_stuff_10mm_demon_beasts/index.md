Description :

~~~
Demon beasts for warmaster both with and without supports using Schlossbauer's awesome sun demon. Note that they fit two on a stand instead of the regular three. I wanted something bigger looking and not necessarily the exact same as each and every other army regarding formations and unit sizes. These are chaos demons!

10mm demon army
See my collections for the other units; I have a unit for each of the roles in warmaster revolution and a couple of heroes. Note that this army does not inherently match one of the big four chaos gods by design, as I find them dreadfully boring.

Supports
The supports are auto generated by Prusa. Be very careful when removing the support from its mouth. I initially removed the circular base, then re-added my own after realizing this model would be likely to break from a stand without one. I call my artful addition "A gentle spring breeze".

Why?
I just got a 3d printer and was looking to get into warmaster with some friends when I noticed that there is no ready to print demon army yet. Given my 0-level modelling skills I instead decided to use existing models to create the army; this unit is one of the outcomes of this project.

Disclaimer
To be sure: none of these models are actually mine. I am a complete hack blundering his way through blender; all I can do is resize models, fatten segments and add cylinders (you may spot some of my handiwork on other models, or here!).
