Description :

~~~
A trio of genetically modified scouts, made to be reminiscent of a rogue-ish 80's style. Currently no pre-supports, but 15mm pre-supports will likely be added in the future.

I took pity on the poor 28mm player and made dedicated 28mm versions with adjusted proportions. I'm not very experienced with 28mm scaling though, so double check them against other models, and possibly scale them up or down just a little bit (I suspect you'll need to scale them down slightly to match original Rogue Trader era scouts).
