Description :

~~~
Due to the number of shipyards producing them, Imperial Battleships can have aesthetic differences between ships belonging to the same class. It is rare for this to affect the effectiveness of these ships in action.

What started as an edit of the prow turned into an almost total rebuild of the older Imperial Battleships from scratch. Probably not compatible with the older design, I decided to just upload it separately. Uses the weapons, doodads and turrets found in Battlefleet Gothic Weapons & Bits https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/battlefleet-gothic-weapons-bits

When I am able to design a nice eagle or angel to sit on the bridge then that will be uploaded.

Probably goes without saying at this point, use it for Battlefleet Gothic or Epic Space Marine/40k/Armageddon!
