Description :

~~~
A blockier rendition of the Space Marine power pack.  The mounting point for attaching the pack is based on the round nub on firstborn marine models.  I'm unsure if it will work with primaris models, but I can make whatever necessary changes needed to make them fit.  Feel free to message me if you need anything tweaked.

Also have multiple objects in each STL file to save on time.  Splitting them apart should be a simple matter in any slicing program, but let me know if you need me to split them apart for you.  Hope you all enjoy
