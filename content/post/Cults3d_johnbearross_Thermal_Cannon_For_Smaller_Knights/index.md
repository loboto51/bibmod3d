Description :

~~~
Hail, Fellow Scions!

The standard Thermal Cannon that comes from the factory is nice, but I wanted a little bit more.

This matches my alternate carapace gun from my other designs.

I magnetize my Knights at the elbow. There's is a socket there for whatever method you prefer. There are two parts...

1-The Main Gun. I print in a vertical orientation. It takes time, but the barrels don't have droop or supports on them.
2.The Optional Gunshield. This is notched to allow the cannon's sensors to view past it, but still provides a bit of cover.

The gunshield slips over the two barrels of the cannon, and should be glued. Some fitting may be required, depending on your printer.

Make sure you send in pics of your Makes!

Instead of tips, please check out my science fiction series on Amazon. Read the preview chapters, and if you like it, download the ebook.

Armored mech warfare in the arenas and streets of a place called Junctionworld!

Thanks,
