Description :

~~~
The legions of Rome often have their strength and skill at arms attributed to their iron discipline and cohesion as a unit. This is true but it is only so due to the officers the form the head and mind of the legion. Centurions are the back bone, leading 80 men platoons they are who the average legionnaire looks to in troubled times. The legates however astride their mighty Nimean Lions, are more then commanders, they are Senators, politicians and more importantly Patriots like none other. They will stand against any barbarian looking to knock at the gates of the Eternal City.
