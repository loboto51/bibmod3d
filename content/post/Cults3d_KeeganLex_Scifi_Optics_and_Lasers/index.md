Description :

~~~
Another super pack, this time with 16 different boltgun scaled red dots/scopes, 6 light/laser modules and one motion tracker.  I went a bit crazy with the details and can't guarantee that all of them will be visible considering the size of the models, though most should be visible with any basic resin printer.  Optics are divided between two STL files while weapon modules are grouped in one STL file.  As always, let me know if you have any questions or complaints.  Enjoy.
