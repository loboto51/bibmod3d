Description :

~~~
Among the largest vessels in the Imperial fleet, battle barges are echoes of a past age. Operated by and carrying hundreds of Imperial Marines, they also bristle with enough firepower to rival any other Imperial vessel. Indeed, it isn't uncommon for Marines deployed to find their landing zones are smoking craters and opposing forces non-existent.

Contains 27 files for standard, Ultima and Ragnarok pattern Battle Barges in both pieces and complete models with a variety of turrets.

Excellent for Battlefleet Gothic, Firestorm Armada, and other space games. Comes with a hole for GW peg-style flight stands. Rules for the Ultima & Ragnarok pattern can be found in the Additional Ships Compendium found at https://sepulchreofheroes.blogspot.com/p/downloads.html
