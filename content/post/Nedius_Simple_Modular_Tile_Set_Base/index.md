Description :

~~~
This is a set of 33 STLs that can act as a base for 2D+ RPG and boardgames set in space / industrial settings. 

It's a base for further modelling and creative work. My plan is to use these as a base to add more detailed parts gathered from my bitz box and things I can print in resin. The FDM printed board tiles will provide a robust base to add the finer detailed parts onto. This is part of a personal modelling project to create a more generic space-corridor themed 2d+ tileset I can use with a range of models to play games like Space Hulk, Aliens, Necromunda, things like that. 

Each tile is based around a 32mmx32mm grid, so the larger bases common on 32mm miniatures will fit into the space. Square shaped floor tiles, cut or printed between 30mm - 32mm square will then fit the floor tiles to create a grid on which to play.

Compatible with my Atmosphere Processor Floor tiles set!

Each board tile features magnet holes for 5x2mm round magnets. However, also provided are two little exta bits - a 'peg' than can be used in place of magnets, and a 1x5mm disc for 'filling' the magnet holes so 5x1mm magnets can be used. When installing pegs, mount them in the lefthand hole only when facing you for each joint. You can do the right hand either, BUT the peg must be in the same side when facing you for every joint. 

Included are two example 30x30mm floor tiles. These can be scaled to suit your preference, but will work at that size, or increased to 31mm or 32mm squared. Also included is an example greeble than can be added to the 'walls', to add a little visual interest.

There will be more complex versions of this set coming, with guide holes for floor tiles, mountings for wall decorations, a range of greebles. This will let me make a long time desired hobby project of an 'Aliens' themed Space Hulk board, so I can play a mix of those two games together!..
