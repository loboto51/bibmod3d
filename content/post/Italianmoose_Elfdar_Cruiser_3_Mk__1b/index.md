Description :

~~~
Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for an Wraith class cruiser for the defunct tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. Tweaked and refreshed with a new sail texture, scaled correctly, and split up in the way that should be a good balance of print speed and quality for resin. The rear hull is common between the types, with the prows being different. A new thing is easier than juggling the old one between Thingi and Cults.
