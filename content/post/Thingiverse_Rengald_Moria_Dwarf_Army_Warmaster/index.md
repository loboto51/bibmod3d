Description :

~~~
Dwarven Army led by King Balin in 10mm scale for Warmaster

This is an army of dwarves using my collection of LotR SBG models in 10mm scale based on models produced by Games Workshop. These models were roughly based for use in Warmaster. Please know that I do not play warmaster so I am only loosely familiar with the basing rules. If there is a problem, the models are available loose on my profile.

NOTE: These models have not been test printed.
