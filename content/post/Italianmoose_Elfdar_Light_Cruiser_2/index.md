Description :

~~~
Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for an Solaris Class light cruiser for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic.

I am not affiliated with GW in any way! Please don't reupload this on Shapeways and the like for commercial use (though you're welcome to upload them to get them printed that way for yourself).

2020-08-26 - Resized and thinned down the rear hull. This should be approximately the same size as the original now :)

2021-08-04 - Re-resized to measurements and added a split version with a joint between prow and rear hull
