Description :

~~~
Six light  Missile Launchers for beakies for the Badass Tyrant's War. Six unique poses of the later style tube missile launcher with the original style armor, fully kitted out with ammo backpack and a pistol holster. One for each of your tactical squads in your battle companies.

These are a full rebuild and remix of the classic Galactic Crusaders models. Thanks to Moonjammy, DangitBobby and JimmyZimms for the base models, and Daffmakes for the builder and assets.

This is a passion project, so please let me know if there are any issues with the files or if you have other ideas for units or weapons to go with this expanding addition to the Galactic Crusaders family.

These are meant to be used for the post Heresy era setting, and in particular, the Bad Ass Tyrant's War campaign. As such the weapon era, look, and loadouts all reflect that. These could easily be used for Heresy though.

Update: One guy was missing the ammo rack for his backpack, so I gave it to him. Sorry little buddy! Now he doesn't have to bum missiles off his brothers. 

"Brother, could I uhh... trouble you for uhhh... "

"You can't have any more of my missiles, Terrence. Go bother another brother. You shouldn't have left your backpack in the Thunderhawk..."
