Description :

~~~
25mm round bases, suitable for Epic or Legions Imperialis, generated with the Starbases Epic Infantry Base Builder.
Includes variations:
- With cutting edge continuous supports, for low resin use, high quality results and next to no post-processing required. Bases print vertically so large numbers of bases can be produced in a single print.
-Unsupported bases included for FDM printing
- With and without 5mm magnet holes
- With a variety of hole counts with sizes suitable for most small scale miniatures

**Want to make fancier bases, or bases with holes to fit different sized miniatures?**

The Epic Infantry Base Builder allows you to make more interesting bases with higher quality supports and customisable hole cutters in just a few clicks in Blender.

To scared to open Blender? Message me and I can generate bases to meet your requirements! 😁
