Description :

~~~
While necron fleets have not been recorded as using ordnance against the Imperial Navy, ships attempting exterminatus on active necron tomb-worlds often deal with swarms of these deadly craft. 

A little idea that has been bouncing around my head for weeks, so I had to let it out. In certain BFG scenarios the defender of a planet gains access to world based ordnance so I figured these may be of use to somebody. A large size provided for those who cannot print the tiny ones with satisfactory results.
