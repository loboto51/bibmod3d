Description :

~~~
Request for some alternate base configurations for Epic infantry.

Remember, you can also flip them round and have the models face the other way for twice the variety.

[20190524]
- added a 32x32mm base for vehicles.
- also expanded the divots from 6mm diameter to 6.5mm, based on print tests that said they were a bit snug.
- also the thin bases (40x12) just so i have everything i need in the same spot.

[20190527]
- added 3 new 32x20mm, looking at HVT (captain/supcmd etc) as middle character with 'minions' protecting/flanking.
