Description :

~~~
Suitable in size and armament for a stand in for a Shadowhunter for the classic tabletop wargame Battlefleet Gothic. Two weapons variants, and two sail variants. Personally I'd split them in two and print two half hulls, but that depends if your printer is as rubbish as mine.

I am not affiliated with GW in any way! Please don't reupload this on Shapeways and the like for commercial use (though you're welcome to upload them to get them printed that way for yourself).

2019-03-27 - Added a thickened up version to make them easier to print in roughly the right size. Less graceful but hopefully more possible!
