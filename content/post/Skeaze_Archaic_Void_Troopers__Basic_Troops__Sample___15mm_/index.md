Description :

~~~
Elite sci-fi troopers in fully sealed armored suits. The design is loosely inspired by "auxiliary" troops that would fight in the era of galactic conquest and civil war 30,000 years in the future...
However, I wanted to make them look more strange and ancient, like they are from a semi-mythologized event that took place 10,000 years in the past. These should also work well in other sci-fi, or even steampunk, weird-war, or post apocalyptic settings.

This pack contains 10 unsupported troopers with laser rifles. It also contains 3 pre-supported* samples: 1 plain laser rifle, 1 laser rifle with an attached power cable connected to a fancy backpack, & 1 with submachinegun-ish gun.

The full set containing unsupported and Pre-Supported versions of all 10 poses of all 3 weapon variants are available here for a small price: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/archaic-void-troopers-basic-troops-full-set-15mm

These are my first full models modeled completely on my own, so if you find any problems please let me know!

*I tend to go heavier on the supports (I'd rather spend a little more time cleaning up supports than have a failure and have to completely re-print it). I use the "hot water method" for removing supports, and didn't have any problems or noticeable scarring. I can't guarantee it will work for all printers and resin though.
