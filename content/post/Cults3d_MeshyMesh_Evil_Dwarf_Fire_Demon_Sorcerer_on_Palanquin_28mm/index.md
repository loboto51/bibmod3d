Description :

~~~
Sorcerers are the undisputed leaders of evil dwarfs well versed in the darkest magics of their patron Bull God.
Some are specialised in the art of Fireborn summoning, so much so they enslave them to other purposes only limited by their imagination.

The palanquin has a 26mm square impression so you can place models with a 25mm base inside of it.
Included in this file to optionally place on top:
- 1 Sorcerer designed to be on a 25mm square base.
- 1 Sacrificial brazier with a 26mm square base already incorporated so it lays flush with the palanquin.

This model is designed as a unit filler for your evil dwarf armies. It is pictured here on a 40mm base.

This file contains:
- 1 Fireborn Sorcerer
- 1 Brazier
- 1 Palanquin with enslaved Fireborn
- 1 Palanquin by itself if you want to model other bearers with it or just as a cool base accessory.

Files come pre-supported and unsupported. 

Happy printing!

Pictures of models are test prints and shown with Fireborn unit for scale.
