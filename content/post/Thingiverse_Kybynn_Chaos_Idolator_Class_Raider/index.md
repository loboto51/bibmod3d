Description :

~~~
I cut it up for printing, so that no supports would be needed.

I shrunk the antennas on the bridge, to ease printing. I included the gun from the Chaos Raiding Ships by Mkhand Industries.

Additionally, I fixed some internal issues within the model. There were quite some holes inside the model.

Besides that, I am looking forward to print it, it looks great I think.

Edit: I printed it, but had some warping issues and the spikey parts did not come out nice. I removed the spikey parts to fit toothpicks.
