Description :

~~~
You can download FREE samples of many of these models here: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/archaic-void-troopers-basic-troops-sample-15mm

Elite sci-fi troopers in fully sealed armored suits. The design is loosely inspired by "auxiliary" troops that would fight in the era of galactic conquest and civil war 30,000 years in the future...
However, I wanted to make them look more strange and ancient, like they are from a semi-mythologized event that took place 10,000 years in the past. These should also work well in other sci-fi, or even steampunk, weird-war, or post apocalyptic settings.

This pack contains 30 total models. 10 each with basic laser guns, lasers guns with a power cable and backpack, and SMG-ish guns.

There are both unsupported, and pre-supported* versions of each, including Lychee files.
<<The SMG variants are not yet fully pre-supported. I ran out of resin before I could finish test printing them. They WILL be updated soon!>>

These are my first full models modeled completely on my own, so if you find any problems please let me know!

*I tend to go heavier on the supports (I'd rather spend a little more time cleaning up supports than have a failure and have to completely re-print it). I use the "hot water method" for removing supports, and didn't have any problems or noticeable scarring. I can't guarantee it will work for all printers and resin though.
