Description :

~~~
Work in progress - I haven't tried printing this just yet and it is missing some parts!  Also, this is my first large model so I'm not sure if the cuts for will work.

This is meant as a proxy for a Battlefleet Gothic ship.  It's a part based on the original miniature and part based on the RTS model.

It's currently missing its antenna (which I'm not a fan of) and I'm not too happy with how the bridge has turned out so I may re-do it.

Please do not upload this to Shapeways.

20/Mar/19 Edit: I fixed a small gap in the main hull but I had to redo all the body.  I've also added a "whole body" model without the cannons or bridge in case anyone wants to cut it up themselves.
21/Mar/19 Edit: Added antenna and a modified bridge with holes for them.
23/Mar/19 Edit: I found some of the detail on the upper back was too small for 0.4mm nozzles so I redesigned those.  With re-doing the cuts these might not be compatible with the earlier versions.
