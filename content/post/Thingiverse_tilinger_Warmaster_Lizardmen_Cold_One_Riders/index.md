Description :

~~~
10mm saurus cold one riders for Warmaster. Six strips, two command, four regular. This took a while, but I learned a couple of thing during the process. Rigging and posing is really easy and fun in blender.

I got the chance to work with a model of mz4250. His models were the main reason I bought my printer.

Edit 2025.09.02: I was a bit unsure about the size of the cold ones, so I had to do a size comparison sketch. I tried to be precise with the original GW one, but it might be a bit off. Nevertheless it seems the GW and Cromarty ones are good matches. Forest Dragon is a bit taller though - the back of the lizards is 3-4mm higher.
