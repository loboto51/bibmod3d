The top of the building is large and flat enough to support a unit placed on top for all 23 hex locations. It is 6 levels tall if you're playing a specific mecha tabletop game. There are two files. One has the building on hexes and the other is hexless so that you can print the one that fits your playstyle. Further, there is a second variation of this building, uploaded as “Library 1A” here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4598463 The difference between the two buildings is that 1A is the &#34;original&#34; version, and for 1B the faces that extend from the side of the upper part of the building do not extend as far. If you do not print at a high enough resolution then the bottom part of those faces may sag slightly on 1A. This is not an issue if you print at a high resolution, and can clean up well if you do experience sagging, but you may choose to use 1B to speed up the print time by lowering the resolution, or because your printer resolution cannot go high enough to print those extra faces without issue. 1B makes the building design less prominent, but it means that if you print the building at a low resolution then those parts won't sag at the bottom. Notable features: -Detailed design including doors, windows, loading docks, steps to an exterior walkway around the building, and a detailed roof area with greebles such as ducting. -Visually interesting exterior design. -The second floor has a curved wall supporting the larger floors on the upper part of the building. This means that the building should print without any supports, and conveniently it is also how the real life building is designed. -This building is closely based on a real life building. It is designed as a library, but you could use it as an office building or something else if you're creative. -This building is fairly large and would provide a great addition to your urban terrain. The model units are in mm and it is scaled such that the hexes are 33mm from flat-to-flat, which is perfect for modern hex maps using 33mm hexes. You can always resize it if your hexes are slightly smaller/larger. Please post pictures and leave feedback if you make this yourself! I'd love to see prints and use the feedback to adjust overhangs, detail levels, etc. on this model and future ones as well.
