What you need to play the game. Terrain features are the none mobile bits that the monsters destroy on their rampages. They may be mounted on any size of base, but the dimensions of the base must be in multiples of 25mm. Units are the combatants in the game. The types of unit used in the game are summarised below: Civilians Civilians are innocent bystanders. Their main purpose is to run, screaming,from the monsters attacking their city and basically get in the way. Military Military units range from squads of soldiers to mecha. They defend cities against the attacks of giant monsters. Monsters Monsters are the strange creatures that have come to destroy the city. They are not limited to giant lizards, but may include any creature or machine that is bent on destruction. Monsters can also be part of the city defences. However, they have to be careful what they stand on. Ideally 1/300th scale figures should be used to represent units. Civilian and Military units should be mounted on 25mm square bases. Monsters may use bases of any size, but the base used will show the area the monster occupies. Sequence Of Play Each turn consists of the following phases: Initiative. All players roll 1d6 to determine the number of Actions they may use this turn. The player with the most actions has the initiative. Active phase. Each player takes one action in order of initiative. This continues until all actions have been taken. Passive phase. The reactions of units which have not acted in the Active Phase are determined. This is done by rolling on the appropriate reaction table for the unit. Once all phases in a turn have been completed, the next turn begins. Actions Each Action represents an opportunity to attack or move. Units may move and attack several times in one turn, provided enough actions are spent to allow them to do so. Any units of the same side which are in base-to-base contact, and which remain so for the duration of the Action, may be treated as a single unit for the purposes of spending Actions. Actions may not be saved for use in later turns. Movement Each unit has a Move Value (MV) and a Move Type. The MV is the distance (in cm) a unit may move per Action. The Move Type is the type of movement a unit uses and is used to determine the effect of terrain on its movement. Move Types There are six Move Types used in Trash Tokyo. These are explained below: AIR Air movement is flight. Units with this type of movement may have a minimum MV (shown as Max MV/Min MV). Units with a minimum MV must move this distance or they are assumed to have crashed and been destroyed. Units which do not have a minimum MV are able to hover in place. See terrain effects. BURROW Some monsters (and possibly some vehicles) are capable of tunnelling through solid matter. Burrowing units are not placed on the playing area until they surface. See terrain effects. G.E.V. This represents vehicles which use thrusters, ducted fans or anti-gravity systems in order to hover just above the surface they are crossing. See terrain effects. GROUND Ground movement is assumed to be any form of movement which requires direct contact with the ground. This includes legs, wheels and tracks. See terrain effects. SUBMARINE Submarine movement allows units to move underwater. Submerged units are not placed on the playing area until they surface. See terrain effects. WATER This is the ability to cross bodies of water. Ships use this Move Type. See terrain effects. Take-offs And Landings Units with the AIR Move Type may take off or land as part of their movement. In order to do so, they must declare this before they conduct any movement. They must then spend an Action to move in a straight line at their minimum MV. At the end of the move, the unit is either airborne or on the ground. No other Actions may be taken by the unit during this turn. Terrain There are three types of terrain in Trash Tokyo: Good, Bad and Impassable. A unit on Good Terrain suffers no penalty to its movement. A unit on Bad Terrain has its movement halved. Units on Impassable Terrain may not move at all. If a unit's move crosses more than one type of terrain, it counts the whole move as being on the worst terrain. The following table gives examples of terrain for each Move Type. Move Types Move type\tgood\tbad\tImpassable Air\tNo high obstacles\tHigh Obstacles (high obstacles are things like sky-scrapers,barrage balloons, mountains, very tall trees)\tN/A Burrow\tSolid Matter\tNot-so solid matter (eg,beneath cities, buildings,badly faulted rock)\tEverything else G.E.V.\tRoads, water, fields\tDestroyed buildings,woods, rough ground\tBuildings Ground\tRoads, fields\tDestroyed buildings, rough ground,woods\tWater, Buildings Submarine\tUnderwater\tWater surface\tEverything else Water\tWater surface\tN/A\tEverything else Buildings Buildings are items of terrain which can be damaged. A building can be anything from a skyscraper to a pylon, or a bridge to a gas tank. . A building is assigned a Defence Value (DV). This determines how fragile the building is. Once a building is destroyed, the area where it stood is considered to be rubble. Some buildings may have special effects associated with them. For example, electricity pylons may electrocute any monster in contact with them, or gas tanks may explode if damaged. The special effects associated with buildings, if any, should be decided upon before play commences. COMBAT Units which are capable of carrying out an attack have an Attack Value (AV), a Range and an Attack Type. The AV represents how much damage the attack is capable of doing. Range is the maximum distance (in cm) the attack may be used to. The Attack Type describes the attack and helps determine its effects. Attack Types The following Attack Types are used in Trash Tokyo. Each attack should have at least one Attack Type from this list. Chemical This represents attacks which are based upon noxious gases, corrosive liquids or other, similar substances. Cold Cold attacks work by lowering the temperature of the target until it suffers damage. Electrical The attack uses an electrical charge in order to do damage. Heat These are the opposite of Cold attacks. Heat attacks include flamethrowers and Martian heat-rays. Impact Impact attacks use kinetic energy to do damage. Most conventional attacks (ie, guns, claws, etc.) are Impact-based. Light The attack uses a burst of high intensity light to disable its target. This is usually a laser beam of some description. Mental These are attacks which do not manifest themselves physically. Instead, these attacks are more subtle in their operation. A successful mental attack generally allows one player to control another player's units. The exact effects of a given mental attack should be agreed upon by the players. Radiation Radiation attacks cover those weapons which use radioactive energy, strange charged particles or other phenomena beloved by physicists. Sonic Any attack which uses powerful sound waves is a sonic attack. An attack may use more than one Attack Type. However, this only increases the chance that it will get past a monster's defences. An attack with more than one Attack Type only rolls for damage once per attack, not once per Attack Type. Attacking In order to use an attack, a unit must pick a visible target that is within the range of its attack. For a unit to use a weapon with a range of 0cm, it must be in base-to-base contact with its target. Range (and line of sight) is measured between the centres of units. If the path is not obstructed by intervening scenery then the unit may open fire. Damage For each point of AV in an attack, the player rolls lD6. Damage is scored as follows: D6 Damage 1-3 No damage 4,5 1 point of damage 6 2 points of damage The amount of damage done is totalled up and then applied. Applying Damage If a target unit has Damage Points, it suffers damage equal to the amount of damage inflicted by the attack divided by its DV. If a unit's Damage Points ever reach 0, the unit is destroyed. If a target unit does not have Damage Points, the amount of damage inflicted by an attack is divided by its DV to give a number. A d6 is rolled and the result compared to that number. If the d6 roll is less than the number calculated, the target is destroyed. Otherwise, it is unaffected. Units with a DV of 0 are automatically destroyed by an attack. If a unit is vulnerable to a certain Attack Type, the unit is treated as having a DV of 1 against that attack. Destroyed units are immediately removed from the table. If a Monster suffers damage, as well as losing Damage Points, the Monster also loses its next Action. Reaction Tables In Trash Tokyo, reaction tables are used to control units (or groups of units) which are not under the direct control of a player. This includes units which have not used any Actions in a turn. Each unit (or group of units) is rolled for once per turn. The reaction table conditions are read from left to right and the first applicable column is used. A D6 is rolled, the modifiers added and the result applied. You are encouraged to experiment with these tables, particularly the Monster Reaction Table. After all, not every monster reacts in the same way, or even to the same things. In fact, some of them may even be intelligent...

MA Fighting retreat The unit moves away losing half its MV, while attacking. R Run Away! The unit moves away as fast as possible. S Scatter! Infantry and Civilians are removed from the playing area. Vehicles are considered to be abandoned. W Wait. The unit stays where it is and does nothing.

The citizens have been evacuated and the Monster Defence Forces have been called in. In the meantime, it is up to the army to keep the creature from destroying the city. This is the standard Trash Tokyo city-stomp. If you get bored with it, try a three-way fight with two monsters fighting against each other and the military trying to keep the damage to a minimum. Alternatively, have a monster on the side of the defenders. Just make sure he doesn't step on anything important.

The Defenders may be placed anywhere within 25cm of one edge of the playing area. The monster is placed within 25cm of the opposite edge. VICTORY CONDITIONS The Defenders win if they defeat the Monster. The Monster wins if it defeats the Defenders or destroys more than 50% of the buildings in the playing area. SPECIAL RULES Buildings may have special effects. For example - pylons may do an AV4 (ELECTRICAL) RANGE 0 attack or gas tanks may explode. The exact effects should be decided on before play starts. From The Depths Strange earthquakes and tidal waves have been reported in the Pacific Ocean. A Naval Task Force discovers a new island has appeared from the depths of the ocean. As the Task Force steams to investigate this occurrence, a hideous monster rises from the depths to bar their way. Modifications to this scenario include putting primitive warriors on the island and giving the defenders a landing craft and troups. Maybe there is something on the island they have to retrieve? Units MONSTERS 1 x ANCIENT GOD Movement: MV: 20 (Air) MV: 10 (Ground) MV: 5 (submarine) MV: 5 (Water) Defences DV:20 Damage Points: 20 Attacks: Breath - AV20 (Chemical) Range 10 Hand to Hand - AV30 (Impact) Range 0 This creature was once worshipped by Primitive Man, but an ancient curse trapped it in its temple beneath the ocean.

DEFENDERS 1 x BATTLECRUISER Movement: MV: 10 (Water) Defences DV: 10 Damage Points: 40 Attacks: Cannon - AV20 (Impact) Range 50 Guns - AV20 (Impact) Range 20 Torpedo - AV40 (Impact) Range 100 The Cannon attack represents the big guns on the battlecruiser, whilst the Guns represent the combined attacks of all the smaller weapons. If a target comes within range of both the Cannon and the Guns, both may be used at a cost of 1 Action. The Battlecruiser only caries 2 torpedoes. 2 x FRIGATE Movement: MV: 20 (Water) Defences DV: 5 Damage Points: 20 Attacks: Guns - AV20 (Impact) Range 20 This is a smaller, less powerful version of the Battlecruiser. SETUP The playing area should be a clear area approximately 1.5m x 1.5m. In the centre of the playing area is a tropical island which should be no bigger than 50cm x 50cm Place the Battlecruiser and the Frigates on one edge of the playing area. Place the Ancient God halfway between the island and the ships. VICTORY CONDITIONS The Defenders win if they manage to destroy the Ancient God. Anything else is a victory for the Ancient God. Attack Of The Space Roaches Aliens have landed on Earth. Twenty four hours ago, a flying saucer landed in the middle of the city. An armed guard was placed around it, but nothing happened. Nothing, that is, until the aliens appeared. As General Killmore said, &#34;I could have coped with little green men, but cockroaches?&#34; Units ALIENS 1 x FLYING SAUCER Movement:\tMV: 50 (Air) Defences\tDV:10\tDamage Points: 40 Attacks:\tHeat Ray -\tAV20 (Heat)\tRange 50 The favourite craft of discerning extra-terrestrials everywhere.

INFANTRY Movement: MV: 2 (Ground) Defences DV: 2 Damage points: 0 Attacks: Personal Weapons - AV5 (Impact) Range 20 This is the standard infantry squad as used by defence forces the world over. ADDITIONAL UNITS CIVILIANS Movement: MV: 2 (Ground) Defences DV: 1 Damage Points: 0 Attacks: YOU HOPE! These are the standard panic stricken city inhabitants whose sole purpose appears to be acting as corn plasters for monsters. SETUP Use a 1.5m x 1.5m playing area. At the centre of the playing area is a 50cm x 50cm clear area. The remainder of the playing area should have buildings and terrain placed in it. Place the Flying Saucer in the centre of the clear area. The Defender must place his units around the edge of the clear area. VICTORY CONDITIONS The Defenders win if they force the Aliens to leave or destroy the Alien forces. The Aliens win if they destroy the Defenders. SPECIAL RULES The city has not been evacuated. Each building contains a base of civilians. Should a building be attacked but not destroyed, the civilians will leave the building. The civilians should be controlled by the Civilian Reaction Table.Alien units may leave and board the Flying Saucer at a rate of 2 units per Action spent. For this scenario, the Flying Saucer is effectively grounded. It will only move if it loses more than 50% of its Damage Points. If this occurs, the Flying Saucer will take off 1d6 turns later. Any Alien units on the playing area will attempt to return to the Flying Saucer before it leaves. If the Flying Saucer loses 75% of its Damage Points it will leave immediately.

What you need to play the game. Terrain features are the none mobile bits that the monsters destroy on their rampages. They may be mounted on any size of base, but the dimensions of the base must be in multiples of 25mm. Units are the combatants in the game. The types of unit used in the game are summarised below: Civilians Civilians are innocent bystanders. Their main purpose is to run, screaming,from the monsters attacking their city and basically get in the way. Military Military units range from squads of soldiers to mecha. They defend cities against the attacks of giant monsters. Monsters Monsters are the strange creatures that have come to destroy the city. They are not limited to giant lizards, but may include any creature or machine that is bent on destruction. Monsters can also be part of the city defences. However, they have to be careful what they stand on. Ideally 1/300th scale figures should be used to represent units. Civilian and Military units should be mounted on 25mm square bases. Monsters may use bases of any size, but the base used will show the area the monster occupies. Sequence Of Play Each turn consists of the following phases: Initiative. All players roll 1d6 to determine the number of Actions they may use this turn. The player with the most actions has the initiative. Active phase. Each player takes one action in order of initiative. This continues until all actions have been taken. Passive phase. The reactions of units which have not acted in the Active Phase are determined. This is done by rolling on the appropriate reaction table for the unit. Once all phases in a turn have been completed, the next turn begins. Actions Each Action represents an opportunity to attack or move. Units may move and attack several times in one turn, provided enough actions are spent to allow them to do so. Any units of the same side which are in base-to-base contact, and which remain so for the duration of the Action, may be treated as a single unit for the purposes of spending Actions. Actions may not be saved for use in later turns. Movement Each unit has a Move Value (MV) and a Move Type. The MV is the distance (in cm) a unit may move per Action. The Move Type is the type of movement a unit uses and is used to determine the effect of terrain on its movement. Move Types There are six Move Types used in Trash Tokyo. These are explained below: AIR Air movement is flight. Units with this type of movement may have a minimum MV (shown as Max MV/Min MV). Units with a minimum MV must move this distance or they are assumed to have crashed and been destroyed. Units which do not have a minimum MV are able to hover in place. See terrain effects. BURROW Some monsters (and possibly some vehicles) are capable of tunnelling through solid matter. Burrowing units are not placed on the playing area until they surface. See terrain effects. G.E.V. This represents vehicles which use thrusters, ducted fans or anti-gravity systems in order to hover just above the surface they are crossing. See terrain effects. GROUND Ground movement is assumed to be any form of movement which requires direct contact with the ground. This includes legs, wheels and tracks. See terrain effects. SUBMARINE Submarine movement allows units to move underwater. Submerged units are not placed on the playing area until they surface. See terrain effects. WATER This is the ability to cross bodies of water. Ships use this Move Type. See terrain effects. Take-offs And Landings Units with the AIR Move Type may take off or land as part of their movement. In order to do so, they must declare this before they conduct any movement. They must then spend an Action to move in a straight line at their minimum MV. At the end of the move, the unit is either airborne or on the ground. No other Actions may be taken by the unit during this turn. Terrain There are three types of terrain in Trash Tokyo: Good, Bad and Impassable. A unit on Good Terrain suffers no penalty to its movement. A unit on Bad Terrain has its movement halved. Units on Impassable Terrain may not move at all. If a unit's move crosses more than one type of terrain, it counts the whole move as being on the worst terrain. The following table gives examples of terrain for each Move Type. Move Types Move type\tgood\tbad\tImpassable Air\tNo high obstacles\tHigh Obstacles (high obstacles are things like sky-scrapers,barrage balloons, mountains, very tall trees)\tN/A Burrow\tSolid Matter\tNot-so solid matter (eg,beneath cities, buildings,badly faulted rock)\tEverything else G.E.V.\tRoads, water, fields\tDestroyed buildings,woods, rough ground\tBuildings Ground\tRoads, fields\tDestroyed buildings, rough ground,woods\tWater, Buildings Submarine\tUnderwater\tWater surface\tEverything else Water\tWater surface\tN/A\tEverything else Buildings Buildings are items of terrain which can be damaged. A building can be anything from a skyscraper to a pylon, or a bridge to a gas tank. . A building is assigned a Defence Value (DV). This determines how fragile the building is. Once a building is destroyed, the area where it stood is considered to be rubble. Some buildings may have special effects associated with them. For example, electricity pylons may electrocute any monster in contact with them, or gas tanks may explode if damaged. The special effects associated with buildings, if any, should be decided upon before play commences. COMBAT Units which are capable of carrying out an attack have an Attack Value (AV), a Range and an Attack Type. The AV represents how much damage the attack is capable of doing. Range is the maximum distance (in cm) the attack may be used to. The Attack Type describes the attack and helps determine its effects. Attack Types The following Attack Types are used in Trash Tokyo. Each attack should have at least one Attack Type from this list. Chemical This represents attacks which are based upon noxious gases, corrosive liquids or other, similar substances. Cold Cold attacks work by lowering the temperature of the target until it suffers damage. Electrical The attack uses an electrical charge in order to do damage. Heat These are the opposite of Cold attacks. Heat attacks include flamethrowers and Martian heat-rays. Impact Impact attacks use kinetic energy to do damage. Most conventional attacks (ie, guns, claws, etc.) are Impact-based. Light The attack uses a burst of high intensity light to disable its target. This is usually a laser beam of some description. Mental These are attacks which do not manifest themselves physically. Instead, these attacks are more subtle in their operation. A successful mental attack generally allows one player to control another player's units. The exact effects of a given mental attack should be agreed upon by the players. Radiation Radiation attacks cover those weapons which use radioactive energy, strange charged particles or other phenomena beloved by physicists. Sonic Any attack which uses powerful sound waves is a sonic attack. An attack may use more than one Attack Type. However, this only increases the chance that it will get past a monster's defences. An attack with more than one Attack Type only rolls for damage once per attack, not once per Attack Type. Attacking In order to use an attack, a unit must pick a visible target that is within the range of its attack. For a unit to use a weapon with a range of 0cm, it must be in base-to-base contact with its target. Range (and line of sight) is measured between the centres of units. If the path is not obstructed by intervening scenery then the unit may open fire. Damage For each point of AV in an attack, the player rolls lD6. Damage is scored as follows: D6 Damage 1-3 No damage 4,5 1 point of damage 6 2 points of damage The amount of damage done is totalled up and then applied. Applying Damage If a target unit has Damage Points, it suffers damage equal to the amount of damage inflicted by the attack divided by its DV. If a unit's Damage Points ever reach 0, the unit is destroyed. If a target unit does not have Damage Points, the amount of damage inflicted by an attack is divided by its DV to give a number. A d6 is rolled and the result compared to that number. If the d6 roll is less than the number calculated, the target is destroyed. Otherwise, it is unaffected. Units with a DV of 0 are automatically destroyed by an attack. If a unit is vulnerable to a certain Attack Type, the unit is treated as having a DV of 1 against that attack. Destroyed units are immediately removed from the table. If a Monster suffers damage, as well as losing Damage Points, the Monster also loses its next Action. Reaction Tables In Trash Tokyo, reaction tables are used to control units (or groups of units) which are not under the direct control of a player. This includes units which have not used any Actions in a turn. Each unit (or group of units) is rolled for once per turn. The reaction table conditions are read from left to right and the first applicable column is used. A D6 is rolled, the modifiers added and the result applied. You are encouraged to experiment with these tables, particularly the Monster Reaction Table. After all, not every monster reacts in the same way, or even to the same things. In fact, some of them may even be intelligent...

MA Fighting retreat The unit moves away losing half its MV, while attacking. R Run Away! The unit moves away as fast as possible. S Scatter! Infantry and Civilians are removed from the playing area. Vehicles are considered to be abandoned. W Wait. The unit stays where it is and does nothing.

The citizens have been evacuated and the Monster Defence Forces have been called in. In the meantime, it is up to the army to keep the creature from destroying the city. This is the standard Trash Tokyo city-stomp. If you get bored with it, try a three-way fight with two monsters fighting against each other and the military trying to keep the damage to a minimum. Alternatively, have a monster on the side of the defenders. Just make sure he doesn't step on anything important.

The Defenders may be placed anywhere within 25cm of one edge of the playing area. The monster is placed within 25cm of the opposite edge. VICTORY CONDITIONS The Defenders win if they defeat the Monster. The Monster wins if it defeats the Defenders or destroys more than 50% of the buildings in the playing area. SPECIAL RULES Buildings may have special effects. For example - pylons may do an AV4 (ELECTRICAL) RANGE 0 attack or gas tanks may explode. The exact effects should be decided on before play starts. From The Depths Strange earthquakes and tidal waves have been reported in the Pacific Ocean. A Naval Task Force discovers a new island has appeared from the depths of the ocean. As the Task Force steams to investigate this occurrence, a hideous monster rises from the depths to bar their way. Modifications to this scenario include putting primitive warriors on the island and giving the defenders a landing craft and troups. Maybe there is something on the island they have to retrieve? Units MONSTERS 1 x ANCIENT GOD Movement: MV: 20 (Air) MV: 10 (Ground) MV: 5 (submarine) MV: 5 (Water) Defences DV:20 Damage Points: 20 Attacks: Breath - AV20 (Chemical) Range 10 Hand to Hand - AV30 (Impact) Range 0 This creature was once worshipped by Primitive Man, but an ancient curse trapped it in its temple beneath the ocean.

If a target comes within range of both the Cannon and the Guns, both may be used at a cost of 1 Action. The Battlecruiser only caries 2 torpedoes. 2 x FRIGATE Movement: MV: 20 (Water) Defences DV: 5 Damage Points: 20 Attacks: Guns - AV20 (Impact) Range 20 This is a smaller, less powerful version of the Battlecruiser. SETUP The playing area should be a clear area approximately 1.5m x 1.5m. In the centre of the playing area is a tropical island which should be no bigger than 50cm x 50cm Place the Battlecruiser and the Frigates on one edge of the playing area. Place the Ancient God halfway between the island and the ships. VICTORY CONDITIONS The Defenders win if they manage to destroy the Ancient God. Anything else is a victory for the Ancient God. Attack Of The Space Roaches Aliens have landed on Earth. Twenty four hours ago, a flying saucer landed in the middle of the city. An armed guard was placed around it, but nothing happened. Nothing, that is, until the aliens appeared. As General Killmore said, &#34;I could have coped with little green men, but cockroaches?&#34; Units ALIENS 1 x FLYING SAUCER Movement:\tMV: 50 (Air) Defences\tDV:10\tDamage Points: 40 Attacks:\tHeat Ray -\tAV20 (Heat)\tRange 50 The favourite craft of discerning extra-terrestrials everywhere.

INFANTRY Movement: MV: 2 (Ground) Defences DV: 2 Damage points: 0 Attacks: Personal Weapons - AV5 (Impact) Range 20 This is the standard infantry squad as used by defence forces the world over. ADDITIONAL UNITS CIVILIANS Movement: MV: 2 (Ground) Defences DV: 1 Damage Points: 0 Attacks: YOU HOPE! These are the standard panic stricken city inhabitants whose sole purpose appears to be acting as corn plasters for monsters. SETUP Use a 1.5m x 1.5m playing area. At the centre of the playing area is a 50cm x 50cm clear area. The remainder of the playing area should have buildings and terrain placed in it. Place the Flying Saucer in the centre of the clear area. The Defender must place his units around the edge of the clear area. VICTORY CONDITIONS The Defenders win if they force the Aliens to leave or destroy the Alien forces. The Aliens win if they destroy the Defenders. SPECIAL RULES The city has not been evacuated. Each building contains a base of civilians. Should a building be attacked but not destroyed, the civilians will leave the building. The civilians should be controlled by the Civilian Reaction Table.Alien units may leave and board the Flying Saucer at a rate of 2 units per Action spent. For this scenario, the Flying Saucer is effectively grounded. It will only move if it loses more than 50% of its Damage Points. If this occurs, the Flying Saucer will take off 1d6 turns later. Any Alien units on the playing area will attempt to return to the Flying Saucer before it leaves. If the Flying Saucer loses 75% of its Damage Points it will leave immediately.

What you need to play the game. Terrain features are the none mobile bits that the monsters destroy on their rampages. They may be mounted on any size of base, but the dimensions of the base must be in multiples of 25mm. Units are the combatants in the game. The types of unit used in the game are summarised below: Civilians Civilians are innocent bystanders. Their main purpose is to run, screaming,from the monsters attacking their city and basically get in the way. Military Military units range from squads of soldiers to mecha. They defend cities against the attacks of giant monsters. Monsters Monsters are the strange creatures that have come to destroy the city. They are not limited to giant lizards, but may include any creature or machine that is bent on destruction. Monsters can also be part of the city defences. However, they have to be careful what they stand on. Ideally 1/300th scale figures should be used to represent units. Civilian and Military units should be mounted on 25mm square bases. Monsters may use bases of any size, but the base used will show the area the monster occupies. Sequence Of Play Each turn consists of the following phases: Initiative. All players roll 1d6 to determine the number of Actions they may use this turn. The player with the most actions has the initiative. Active phase. Each player takes one action in order of initiative. This continues until all actions have been taken. Passive phase. The reactions of units which have not acted in the Active Phase are determined. This is done by rolling on the appropriate reaction table for the unit. Once all phases in a turn have been completed, the next turn begins. Actions Each Action represents an opportunity to attack or move. Units may move and attack several times in one turn, provided enough actions are spent to allow them to do so. Any units of the same side which are in base-to-base contact, and which remain so for the duration of the Action, may be treated as a single unit for the purposes of spending Actions. Actions may not be saved for use in later turns. Movement Each unit has a Move Value (MV) and a Move Type. The MV is the distance (in cm) a unit may move per Action. The Move Type is the type of movement a unit uses and is used to determine the effect of terrain on its movement. Move Types There are six Move Types used in Trash Tokyo. These are explained below: AIR Air movement is flight. Units with this type of movement may have a minimum MV (shown as Max MV/Min MV). Units with a minimum MV must move this distance or they are assumed to have crashed and been destroyed. Units which do not have a minimum MV are able to hover in place. See terrain effects. BURROW Some monsters (and possibly some vehicles) are capable of tunnelling through solid matter. Burrowing units are not placed on the playing area until they surface. See terrain effects. G.E.V. This represents vehicles which use thrusters, ducted fans or anti-gravity systems in order to hover just above the surface they are crossing. See terrain effects. GROUND Ground movement is assumed to be any form of movement which requires direct contact with the ground. This includes legs, wheels and tracks. See terrain effects. SUBMARINE Submarine movement allows units to move underwater. Submerged units are not placed on the playing area until they surface. See terrain effects. WATER This is the ability to cross bodies of water. Ships use this Move Type. See terrain effects. Take-offs And Landings Units with the AIR Move Type may take off or land as part of their movement. In order to do so, they must declare this before they conduct any movement. They must then spend an Action to move in a straight line at their minimum MV. At the end of the move, the unit is either airborne or on the ground. No other Actions may be taken by the unit during this turn. Terrain There are three types of terrain in Trash Tokyo: Good, Bad and Impassable. A unit on Good Terrain suffers no penalty to its movement. A unit on Bad Terrain has its movement halved. Units on Impassable Terrain may not move at all. If a unit's move crosses more than one type of terrain, it counts the whole move as being on the worst terrain. The following table gives examples of terrain for each Move Type. Move Types Move type\tgood\tbad\tImpassable Air\tNo high obstacles\tHigh Obstacles (high obstacles are things like sky-scrapers,barrage balloons, mountains, very tall trees)\tN/A Burrow\tSolid Matter\tNot-so solid matter (eg,beneath cities, buildings,badly faulted rock)\tEverything else G.E.V.\tRoads, water, fields\tDestroyed buildings,woods, rough ground\tBuildings Ground\tRoads, fields\tDestroyed buildings, rough ground,woods\tWater, Buildings Submarine\tUnderwater\tWater surface\tEverything else Water\tWater surface\tN/A\tEverything else Buildings Buildings are items of terrain which can be damaged. A building can be anything from a skyscraper to a pylon, or a bridge to a gas tank. . A building is assigned a Defence Value (DV). This determines how fragile the building is. Once a building is destroyed, the area where it stood is considered to be rubble. Some buildings may have special effects associated with them. For example, electricity pylons may electrocute any monster in contact with them, or gas tanks may explode if damaged. The special effects associated with buildings, if any, should be decided upon before play commences. COMBAT Units which are capable of carrying out an attack have an Attack Value (AV), a Range and an Attack Type. The AV represents how much damage the attack is capable of doing. Range is the maximum distance (in cm) the attack may be used to. The Attack Type describes the attack and helps determine its effects. Attack Types The following Attack Types are used in Trash Tokyo. Each attack should have at least one Attack Type from this list. Chemical This represents attacks which are based upon noxious gases, corrosive liquids or other, similar substances. Cold Cold attacks work by lowering the temperature of the target until it suffers damage. Electrical The attack uses an electrical charge in order to do damage. Heat These are the opposite of Cold attacks. Heat attacks include flamethrowers and Martian heat-rays. Impact Impact attacks use kinetic energy to do damage. Most conventional attacks (ie, guns, claws, etc.) are Impact-based. Light The attack uses a burst of high intensity light to disable its target. This is usually a laser beam of some description. Mental These are attacks which do not manifest themselves physically. Instead, these attacks are more subtle in their operation. A successful mental attack generally allows one player to control another player's units. The exact effects of a given mental attack should be agreed upon by the players. Radiation Radiation attacks cover those weapons which use radioactive energy, strange charged particles or other phenomena beloved by physicists. Sonic Any attack which uses powerful sound waves is a sonic attack. An attack may use more than one Attack Type. However, this only increases the chance that it will get past a monster's defences. An attack with more than one Attack Type only rolls for damage once per attack, not once per Attack Type. Attacking In order to use an attack, a unit must pick a visible target that is within the range of its attack. For a unit to use a weapon with a range of 0cm, it must be in base-to-base contact with its target. Range (and line of sight) is measured between the centres of units. If the path is not obstructed by intervening scenery then the unit may open fire. Damage For each point of AV in an attack, the player rolls lD6. Damage is scored as follows: D6 Damage 1-3 No damage 4,5 1 point of damage 6 2 points of damage The amount of damage done is totalled up and then applied. Applying Damage If a target unit has Damage Points, it suffers damage equal to the amount of damage inflicted by the attack divided by its DV. If a unit's Damage Points ever reach 0, the unit is destroyed. If a target unit does not have Damage Points, the amount of damage inflicted by an attack is divided by its DV to give a number. A d6 is rolled and the result compared to that number. If the d6 roll is less than the number calculated, the target is destroyed. Otherwise, it is unaffected. Units with a DV of 0 are automatically destroyed by an attack. If a unit is vulnerable to a certain Attack Type, the unit is treated as having a DV of 1 against that attack. Destroyed units are immediately removed from the table. If a Monster suffers damage, as well as losing Damage Points, the Monster also loses its next Action. Reaction Tables In Trash Tokyo, reaction tables are used to control units (or groups of units) which are not under the direct control of a player. This includes units which have not used any Actions in a turn. Each unit (or group of units) is rolled for once per turn. The reaction table conditions are read from left to right and the first applicable column is used. A D6 is rolled, the modifiers added and the result applied. You are encouraged to experiment with these tables, particularly the Monster Reaction Table. After all, not every monster reacts in the same way, or even to the same things. In fact, some of them may even be intelligent...

MA Fighting retreat The unit moves away losing half its MV, while attacking. R Run Away! The unit moves away as fast as possible. S Scatter! Infantry and Civilians are removed from the playing area. Vehicles are considered to be abandoned. W Wait. The unit stays where it is and does nothing.

The citizens have been evacuated and the Monster Defence Forces have been called in. In the meantime, it is up to the army to keep the creature from destroying the city. This is the standard Trash Tokyo city-stomp. If you get bored with it, try a three-way fight with two monsters fighting against each other and the military trying to keep the damage to a minimum. Alternatively, have a monster on the side of the defenders. Just make sure he doesn't step on anything important. Units MONSTERS 1 x GIANT RADIOACTIVE DINOSAUR Movement: MV: 10 (Ground) MV: 5 (submarine) MV: 5 (Water) Defences DV:10 Damage Points: 25 Attacks: Eye Beams - AV10 (Heat, Light) Range 20 Radioactive Breath - AV20 (Heat,Radiation) Range 10 Hand to Hand - AV25 (Impact) Range 0 Atomic tests in the Antarctic woke this monster from its frozen slumber of 65 million years.

They fire different beams depending on the monster they are facing. SETUP The playing area is 1.5m x 1.5m. Place buildings within the playing area as desired. The Defenders may be placed anywhere within 25cm of one edge of the playing area. The monster is placed within 25cm of the opposite edge. VICTORY CONDITIONS The Defenders win if they defeat the Monster. The Monster wins if it defeats the Defenders or destroys more than 50% of the buildings in the playing area. SPECIAL RULES Buildings may have special effects. For example - pylons may do an AV4 (ELECTRICAL) RANGE 0 attack or gas tanks may explode. The exact effects should be decided on before play starts. From The Depths Strange earthquakes and tidal waves have been reported in the Pacific Ocean. A Naval Task Force discovers a new island has appeared from the depths of the ocean. As the Task Force steams to investigate this occurrence, a hideous monster rises from the depths to bar their way. Modifications to this scenario include putting primitive warriors on the island and giving the defenders a landing craft and troups. Maybe there is something on the island they have to retrieve? Units MONSTERS 1 x ANCIENT GOD Movement: MV: 20 (Air) MV: 10 (Ground) MV: 5 (submarine) MV: 5 (Water) Defences DV:20 Damage Points: 20 Attacks: Breath - AV20 (Chemical) Range 10 Hand to Hand - AV30 (Impact) Range 0 This creature was once worshipped by Primitive Man, but an ancient curse trapped it in its temple beneath the ocean.

DEFENDERS 1 x BATTLECRUISER Movement: MV: 10 (Water) Defences DV: 10 Damage Points: 40 Attacks: Cannon - AV20 (Impact) Range 50 Guns - AV20 (Impact) Range 20 Torpedo - AV40 (Impact) Range 100 The Cannon attack represents the big guns on the battlecruiser, whilst the Guns represent the combined attacks of all the smaller weapons. If a target comes within range of both the Cannon and the Guns, both may be used at a cost of 1 Action. The Battlecruiser only caries 2 torpedoes. 2 x FRIGATE Movement: MV: 20 (Water) Defences DV: 5 Damage Points: 20 Attacks: Guns - AV20 (Impact) Range 20 This is a smaller, less powerful version of the Battlecruiser. SETUP The playing area should be a clear area approximately 1.5m x 1.5m. In the centre of the playing area is a tropical island which should be no bigger than 50cm x 50cm Place the Battlecruiser and the Frigates on one edge of the playing area. Place the Ancient God halfway between the island and the ships. VICTORY CONDITIONS The Defenders win if they manage to destroy the Ancient God. Anything else is a victory for the Ancient God. Attack Of The Space Roaches Aliens have landed on Earth. Twenty four hours ago, a flying saucer landed in the middle of the city. An armed guard was placed around it, but nothing happened. Nothing, that is, until the aliens appeared. As General Killmore said, &#34;I could have coped with little green men, but cockroaches?&#34; Units ALIENS 1 x FLYING SAUCER Movement:\tMV: 50 (Air) Defences\tDV:10\tDamage Points: 40 Attacks:\tHeat Ray -\tAV20 (Heat)\tRange 50 The favourite craft of discerning extra-terrestrials everywhere.

Note that it does not have any Damage Points. INFANTRY Movement: MV: 2 (Ground) Defences DV: 2 Damage points: 0 Attacks: Personal Weapons - AV5 (Impact) Range 20 This is the standard infantry squad as used by defence forces the world over. ADDITIONAL UNITS CIVILIANS Movement: MV: 2 (Ground) Defences DV: 1 Damage Points: 0 Attacks: YOU HOPE! These are the standard panic stricken city inhabitants whose sole purpose appears to be acting as corn plasters for monsters. SETUP Use a 1.5m x 1.5m playing area. At the centre of the playing area is a 50cm x 50cm clear area. The remainder of the playing area should have buildings and terrain placed in it. Place the Flying Saucer in the centre of the clear area. The Defender must place his units around the edge of the clear area. VICTORY CONDITIONS The Defenders win if they force the Aliens to leave or destroy the Alien forces. The Aliens win if they destroy the Defenders. SPECIAL RULES The city has not been evacuated. Each building contains a base of civilians. Should a building be attacked but not destroyed, the civilians will leave the building. The civilians should be controlled by the Civilian Reaction Table.Alien units may leave and board the Flying Saucer at a rate of 2 units per Action spent. For this scenario, the Flying Saucer is effectively grounded. It will only move if it loses more than 50% of its Damage Points. If this occurs, the Flying Saucer will take off 1d6 turns later. Any Alien units on the playing area will attempt to return to the Flying Saucer before it leaves. If the Flying Saucer loses 75% of its Damage Points it will leave immediately.

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>What you need to play the game. 
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Terrain features are the none mobile bits that the monsters destroy on their rampages. They may be mounted on any size of base, but the dimensions of the base must be in multiples of 25mm.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Units are the combatants in the game. The types of unit used in the game are summarised below:
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Civilians
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Civilians are innocent bystanders. Their main purpose is to run, screaming,from the monsters attacking their city and basically get in the way.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Military
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Military units range from squads of soldiers to mecha. They defend cities against the attacks of giant monsters.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Monsters
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Monsters are the strange creatures that have come to destroy the city. They are not limited to giant lizards, but may include any creature or machine that is bent on destruction. Monsters can also be part of the city defences. However, they have to be careful what they stand on.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Ideally 1/300th scale figures should be used to represent units. Civilian and Military units should be mounted on 25mm square bases. Monsters may use bases of any size, but the base used will show the area the monster occupies.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Sequence Of Play
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Each turn consists of the following phases:
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Initiative. All players roll 1d6 to determine the number of Actions they may use this turn. The player with the most actions has the initiative.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Active phase. Each player takes one action in order of initiative. This continues until all actions have been taken.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Passive phase. The reactions of units which have not acted in the Active Phase are determined. This is done by rolling on the appropriate reaction table for the unit.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Once all phases in a turn have been completed, the next turn begins.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Actions
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Each Action represents an opportunity to attack or move. Units may move and attack several times in one turn, provided enough actions are spent to allow them to do so. Any units of the same side which are in base-to-base contact, and which remain so for the duration of the Action, may be treated as a single unit for the purposes of spending Actions. Actions may not be saved for use in later turns.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Movement
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Each unit has a Move Value (MV) and a Move Type. The MV is the distance (in cm) a unit may move per Action. The Move Type is the type of movement a unit uses and is used to determine the effect of terrain on its movement.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Move Types
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>There are six Move Types used in Trash Tokyo. These are explained below:
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>AIR
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Air movement is flight. Units with this type of movement may have a minimum MV (shown as Max MV/Min MV). Units with a minimum MV must move this distance or they are assumed to have crashed and been destroyed. Units which do not have a minimum MV are able to hover in place.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>See terrain effects.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>BURROW
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Some monsters (and possibly some vehicles) are capable of tunnelling through solid matter. Burrowing units are not placed on the playing area until they surface.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>See terrain effects.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>G.E.V.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>This represents vehicles which use thrusters, ducted fans or anti-gravity systems in order to hover just above the surface they are crossing.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>See terrain effects.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>GROUND
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Ground movement is assumed to be any form of movement which requires direct contact with the ground. This includes legs, wheels and tracks.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>See terrain effects.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>SUBMARINE
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Submarine movement allows units to move underwater. Submerged units are not placed on the playing area until they surface.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>See terrain effects.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>WATER
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>This is the ability to cross bodies of water. Ships use this Move Type.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>See terrain effects.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Take-offs And Landings
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Units with the AIR Move Type may take off or land as part of their movement. In order to do so, they must declare this before they conduct any movement. They must then spend an Action to move in a straight line at their minimum MV. At the end of the move, the unit is either airborne or on the ground. No other Actions may be taken by the unit during this turn.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Terrain
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>There are three types of terrain in Trash Tokyo: Good, Bad and Impassable. A unit on Good Terrain suffers no penalty to its movement. A unit on Bad Terrain has its movement halved. Units on Impassable Terrain may not move at all. If a unit&#39;s move crosses more than one type of terrain, it counts the whole move as being on the worst terrain.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>The following table gives examples of terrain for each Move Type. 
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Move Types
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Move type	good	bad	Impassable
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Air	No high obstacles	High Obstacles (high obstacles are things like sky-scrapers,barrage balloons, mountains, very tall trees)	N/A
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Burrow	Solid Matter	Not-so solid matter (eg,beneath cities, buildings,badly faulted rock)	Everything else
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>G.E.V.	Roads, water, fields	Destroyed buildings,woods, rough ground	Buildings
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Ground	Roads, fields	Destroyed buildings, rough ground,woods	Water, Buildings
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Submarine	Underwater	Water surface	Everything else
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Water	Water surface	N/A	Everything else
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Buildings
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Buildings are items of terrain which can be damaged. A building can be anything from a skyscraper to a pylon, or a bridge to a gas tank. . A building is assigned a Defence Value (DV). This determines how fragile the building is. Once a building is destroyed, the area where it stood is considered to be rubble. Some buildings may have special effects associated with them. For example, electricity pylons may electrocute any monster in contact with them, or gas tanks may explode if damaged. The special effects associated with buildings, if any, should be decided upon before play commences.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>COMBAT
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Units which are capable of carrying out an attack have an Attack Value (AV), a Range and an Attack Type. The AV represents how much damage the attack is capable of doing. Range is the maximum distance (in cm) the attack may be used to. The Attack Type describes the attack and helps determine its effects. Attack Types The following Attack Types are used in Trash Tokyo. Each attack should have at least one Attack Type from this list.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Chemical
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>This represents attacks which are based upon noxious gases, corrosive liquids or other, similar substances.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Cold
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Cold attacks work by lowering the temperature of the target until it suffers damage.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Electrical
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>The attack uses an electrical charge in order to do damage.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Heat
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>These are the opposite of Cold attacks. Heat attacks include flamethrowers and Martian heat-rays.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Impact
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Impact attacks use kinetic energy to do damage. Most conventional attacks (ie, guns, claws, etc.) are Impact-based.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Light
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>The attack uses a burst of high intensity light to disable its target. This is usually a laser beam of some description.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Mental
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>These are attacks which do not manifest themselves physically. Instead, these attacks are more subtle in their operation. A successful mental attack generally allows one player to control another player&#39;s units. The exact effects of a given mental attack should be agreed upon by the players.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Radiation
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Radiation attacks cover those weapons which use radioactive energy, strange charged particles or other phenomena beloved by physicists.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Sonic
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Any attack which uses powerful sound waves is a sonic attack.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>An attack may use more than one Attack Type. However, this only increases the chance that it will get past a monster&#39;s defences. An attack with more than one Attack Type only rolls for damage once per attack, not once per Attack Type.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Attacking
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>In order to use an attack, a unit must pick a visible target that is within the range of its attack.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>For a unit to use a weapon with a range of 0cm, it must be in base-to-base contact with its target. 
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Range (and line of sight) is measured between the centres of units. If the path is not obstructed by intervening scenery then the unit may open fire.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Damage
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>For each point of AV in an attack, the player rolls lD6. Damage is scored as follows:
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>D6   Damage
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>1-3       No damage
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>4,5       1 point of damage
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>6         2 points of damage 
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>The amount of damage done is totalled up and then applied.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Applying Damage
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>If a target unit has Damage Points, it suffers damage equal to the amount of damage inflicted by the attack divided by its DV. If a unit&#39;s Damage Points ever reach 0, the unit is destroyed.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>If a target unit does not have Damage Points, the amount of damage inflicted by an attack is divided by its DV to give a number. A d6 is rolled and the result compared to that number. If the d6 roll is less than the number calculated, the target is destroyed. Otherwise, it is unaffected.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Units with a DV of 0 are automatically destroyed by an attack.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>If a unit is vulnerable to a certain Attack Type, the unit is treated as having a DV of 1 against that attack.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Destroyed units are immediately removed from the table.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>If a Monster suffers damage, as well as losing Damage Points, the Monster also loses its next Action.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Reaction Tables
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>In Trash Tokyo, reaction tables are used to control units (or groups of units) which are not under the direct control of a player. This includes units which have not used any Actions in a turn. Each unit (or group of units) is rolled for once per turn. The reaction table conditions are read from left to right and the first applicable column is used. A D6 is rolled, the modifiers added and the result applied. You are encouraged to experiment with these tables, particularly the Monster Reaction Table. After all, not every monster reacts in the same way, or even to the same things. In fact, some of them may even be intelligent...

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>Downtown Tokyo is threatened by a Giant Radioactive Dinosaur. The citizens have been evacuated and the Monster Defence Forces have been called in. In the meantime, it is up to the army to keep the creature from destroying the city.
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>This is the standard Trash Tokyo city-stomp. If you get bored with it, try a three-way fight with two monsters fighting against each other and the military trying to keep the damage to a minimum. Alternatively, have a monster on the side of the defenders. Just make sure he doesn&#39;t step on anything important.
