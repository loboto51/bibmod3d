I thought it was time to update the scaling model I use (sorry, [Sgt.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1465372), but you had your time). This guy can be uploaded into whatever slicing program you're using (or 3d Builder, Blender, whatever) and placed beside a model for the ol' eyeball test if you're adjusting the scale before printing or releasing a design. People tend to get hung up on scale issues, and there's a lot of misinformation out there. You'll notice that the bigger companies don't tend to list a scale for their models (and often won't engage inquiries about scale). Some random thoughts on scale- *Most things aren't 28mm.* I know that a lot of models claim to be, and people toss that scale around because it's what they've heard/know, but these days it's pretty uncommon. The majority of miniatures you'll find (3d printed or otherwise) are pretty firmly in the 30 to 32mm range. *&#34;Heroic Scale&#34; isn't a scale.* It's a style. It just means that the head and hands are a little larger than they should be. This conveys a slightly cartoonish look that works well with smaller things (making them easily identifiable). *25mm bases aren't an indication of scale.* This is just the diameter of the base (about .5mm short of an inch), and it's the most commonly used base dimensions for human-ish models in scales ranging from 25mm to 34mm (especially when using laser cut bases, which are pretty popular). In lots of games, an inch is meant to equate to 5 feet. This really depends on scale of the model though, and if you're looking to design terrain based on those numerics, chances are you'll be disappointed with the result. *Scale isn't determined by the top of the head.* It should be. It really should. But, thanks to some hoary old rules, it's based on the eyeline of a regular tall-ish person. You've got all those accurate model scales, like 1/72 and the like, and we probably should be using those, but... this is what we've got. *Don't worry about it too much!* If it passes the initial eyeball test, just go with it, especially when you're playing. I generally use models ranging from 28mm to 32mm together, and it's just fine. But, if you are a stickler for these kinds of things, it's lucky that we live in an age where you can scale models easily before you print (and I hope this model helps in your endeavor).
