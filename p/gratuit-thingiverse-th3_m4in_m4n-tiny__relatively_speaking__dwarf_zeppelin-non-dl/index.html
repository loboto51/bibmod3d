The story is short: I wanted a zeppelin for my new Warmaster dwarf army and I didn't find anything I really liked, so I took the best pieces of everything I found and built my own zeppelin. Since there are no official rules to use it in the game, I took the liberty of playing around with some ideas and in the end I decided that this zeppelin would be equipped with a conventional cannon and four &#34;machine guns&#34; (my idea is that they work in a similar way to imperial volleygun). I plan to upload the rules to use it in the game, but I need to do some playtesting before sharing anything. Now, a few notes regarding the impression that I should mention: First, the balloon: I printed it in PLA only because my resin printer (a Halot One) is very small and I also felt that it was going to be too much for it, but if you have a printer with more testosterone than mine, I think you can try printing both parts in resin (don't forget to hollow them out). Second, the gondola: I printed this in resin, but for the same reason as before, I did it in separate pieces. The problem I had was that I experienced some warping (I don't have much experience printing large, flat pieces), as a result ugly gaps were created between the pieces which I was forced to fill with epoxy putty and covered with a decorative trim that i sculpted by hand (which, for obvious reasons, is not included in the 3d model). I think the ideal is to print the entire gondola at once, although I cannot guarantee that it will turn out well, that depends on how you configure the model in the slicer, the supports and your printer. Additionally, the anchors are fragile and may break or not print correctly, as happened to me. That's why I included a small anchor model in case you need to repair this piece. Third, the base: If you are going to print it in PLA, I strongly recommend that you print the rod horizontally, that way you will give it much more resistance than if you print it vertically. I designed it to be inserted into the base from below. On the other hand, if you want to print the base and the rod in resin, I can't do anything other than wish you good luck xD "><title>[GRATUIT] Thingiverse > Th3_M4in_M4n > Tiny__relatively_speaking__Dwarf_Zeppelin [non dl]</title><link rel=canonical href=https://loboto51.github.io/bibmod3d/p/gratuit-thingiverse-th3_m4in_m4n-tiny__relatively_speaking__dwarf_zeppelin-non-dl/><link rel=stylesheet href=/bibmod3d/scss/style.min.b0e76e98cdd4f7082d1fc36f7af7e0843a81201db2197c03ca426751dc923735.css><meta property='og:title' content="[GRATUIT] Thingiverse > Th3_M4in_M4n > Tiny__relatively_speaking__Dwarf_Zeppelin [non dl]"><meta property='og:description' content="\nSource : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6608201\nId objet : 6608201\nPrix : 0 euros\nCollections :\nwarmaster NAINS Collections pour tags :\nwarmaster NAINS NONDL NONSUP Description :\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 A small (not really) zeppelin to give some air superiority to your dwarfs!

I think the ideal is to print the entire gondola at once, although I cannot guarantee that it will turn out well, that depends on how you configure the model in the slicer, the supports and your printer.</span>
